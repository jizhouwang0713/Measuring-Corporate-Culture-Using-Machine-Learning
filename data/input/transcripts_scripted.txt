Good morning. I am Doug MacMillan, Cambrex Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I just want to remind everyone that the meeting is held today under the terms of the Safe Harbor disclaimer. That disclaimer reads as follows: The following discussion may contain certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and Rule 3B-6 under the Exchange Act. Although such statements represent management's best judgment as of today and that information currently available, such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. I would also like to ask everyone to follow a few guidelines. The conference call will be a maximum of one hour and we will begin with business highlights from Jim Mack, Cambrex Chairman and Chief Executive followed by a question-and-answer session. We request that you ask one question at a time, but we will honor a request for one clarification if required. This will allow everyone to ask at least one question. Let me now turn the meeting over to Jim Mack, Cambrex Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Okay. Thank you, Doug. Welcome everyone. Just for those who may not have seen the press release, I wanted to cover a few highlights from the first quarter before we open it up to Q&A. We had record earnings, up 20% over the first quarter last year and revenue across the entire business was up 9.8%. The Human Health category was up 10% in revenue and would have been 16% increase except for foreign exchange. The Bioscience business was up 43% in revenue. We were also able to increase our gross profit in the Life Science sector, mainly by eliminating low margin products and replacing them with higher margin new products, improved productivity, and new product growth. We have over $25 million of revenue in the budget for new products that are new in the year 2000. And the focus is primarily on proprietary products and services and to a lesser extent some of these do involve service to large pharma. Our repositioning of the Company into life science is proceeding very well. In the quarter, over 83% of the gross profit came from Human Health and Bioscience, up from about 73% last year. In the past year, we completed four acquisitions, all in the life science sector, and all accretive to earnings. Each one of these gives us a new technology platform to build on for the future. We expect there will be a major change in the business model for the way new drug discovery takes place, the way lead compounds are selected and optimized, clinical trials are performed, and resulting in new and different product approvals. This is really going to be driven by the fact that costs for new drug delivery must be reduced by millions – hundreds of millions of dollars and time must be reduced, not by a few months, but by a matter of years. We are involved in this now in a small way and we'll be adding more products and more services in the future to take advantage of this major shift. One example of building for the future that I would like to mention was our acquisition of Chiragene from Celgene two years ago. This is really a new technology platform based on enzyme chemistry. It's an R&D program, but it is being run as a business and in the first two years it costs us a couple of million dollars a year. Now it's beginning to pay off. We developed a new patented route to Taxol Side Chain and have manufactured and shipped several thousand dollars worth of the new compounds. Chiragene has developed a new route for controlled substances used for ADD or attention deficit disorder. We've produced 100 kilogram quantities in the Chiragene cGMP pilot plant and the larger scale production will be at our Charles City, Iowa facility where this business will grow to at least $10 million over the next couple of years. They are also working on chiral compounds at Chiragene, using enzymes to produce a new class of materials called epoxide hydrolase. These will be used to make new chiral building blocks for new drugs. Lastly, I would just like to mention that the demand for active pharmaceutical ingredients for the generic pharmaceutical companies continues to grow and our order backlog is at an all time high. As many of you know, we have the number one position in this field in terms of the number of compounds or active ingredients that are offered, and we expect to add 6-8 new compounds a year going forward. Tracy, we can now open it up for questions.
This is Doug MacMillan, Cambrex Chief Financial Officer. Jim will be on in just a minute. Before we begin, I just want to remind everyone that the meeting is held today under the terms of the Safe Harbor disclaimer. The following discussion may contain certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and Rule 3B-6 under the Exchange Act. Although such statements represent management's best judgment as of today and on information currently available, such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. I would also like everyone to follow a few guidelines during the conference call. It will be a maximum of one hour. We will begin with business highlights from Jim Mack, Cambrex Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by a question-and-answer session. We request that you ask one question at a time, but we will honor the request for one clarification if required. This will provide access to everyone's questions. Now, let me turn the meeting over to Jim Mack. Okay. Thank you, Doug. Good morning everyone. I'll take a few minutes to discuss some of the highlights from the second quarter of 2000. As you saw from our press release, we did have record earnings for the second quarter, 14.2 million, up 19% from the prior year. Although the strong dollar did negatively impact the Human Health sales growth, in addition, as we mentioned, we experienced several customer overstock situations and in addition to that, we've dropped a number of products that had deteriorating margins ass part of our continuous product rationalization activity. That, combined with the product mix for the quarter, increased our margins – our gross margins from 34.7% to 38.2%. Lastly in that category, as you've seen from other press releases, the Mylan situation is now behind us. Next I want to comment on some small, but very important transactions that we made recently. First we acquired a line of zinc and chromium picolinates that are used in human and animal nutrition. This chemistry is a very nice fit with our existing pyridine technologies. And in time, these will add several million dollars of very highly profitable business. We are going to move the manufacturing of those products into our facility at Zeeland, Michigan. Second, we just announced the acquisition of LumiTech, a technology-based company in the U.K. This purchase further supports our entry into the high throughput screening market with very novel and patented luminescent technology. For those of you who were with us at Investor Day, May 16th at BioWhittaker, we talked fairly extensively about the changes taking place in drug discovery and drug development, opening the way for new cell-based high throughput screening assays to test the toxicity of drug candidates to better select the leads that will then be processed through animal testing and clinical trials. This technology provides a definitive advantage to us in terms of sensitivity, speed, and having a wide dynamic assay range. LumiTech already has two products that are being introduced into the market and they have several others in the pipeline. We plan to integrate these products and services into our existing bioscience infrastructure. In addition to the product sales alone, which we expect to grow to over $20 million, we plan to use this acquisition as a further foundation for our bioassay service business that we will be building on. In addition to these two acquisitions, we announced a supply agreement for Cecure, a proprietary antibacterial formulation for food and food processing equipment. This material has shown a dramatic ability to eliminate bacteria, such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria. We have been waiting all year for the FDA to approve this application, and we now expect this to be completed by October and if that's the case with this will add, we expect, several million dollars worth of top line sales in the year 2001. Moving to a different topic. As a consequence of our strengthening our sales force beginning last year, we are now seeing a record number of project opportunities. For new products introduced this year alone, we expect over $15 million in revenue, and we are on track to achieve that. Also as a result of this, several of our labs are running at capacity working on these new projects. So as a result of that, we are expanding facilities and hiring more chemists. We are also further expanding our pilot facilities in Charles City, Iowa, and we are on schedule to occupy the Center for Technical Excellence in the fourth quarter, probably October rather than November. And on Thursday this week we will review with our Board of Directors, the scope for Phase II and Phase III for the technical center. We expect phase II to be approved in October, which will provide cGMP kilo lab facilities. Following that Phase III, we'll add a cGMP pilot plant into the Center for Technical Excellence. Lastly I just want to mention, as we have been recruiting scientists, chemists, we've recently hired another top-notch molecular scientist, Dr. Daniel Marshak, who will become Vice President of R&D at BioWhittaker. Dr. Marshak is an expert in biochemistry and cell biology. He has experience at the National Institute of Health. He was head of the research lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories and was most recently Chief Scientific Officer at Osiris Therapeutics and he has a very strong reputation for converting technology into marketable products. Secondly, we have just hired Dr. Jeffrey Kelly who joins BioWhittaker as Technical Director for Molecular Biology Products. Dr. Kelly was most recently R&D Group Manager for Protein Expression for Promega Corporation. As we are building our business based on technology platforms, we are adding the best people we can find to support our growth in these areas. I would now open it up to the Q&A session. Operator.
Hello and welcome. Before we begin, I just want to remind everyone that the meeting is held today under the terms of the Safe Harbor disclaimer.

Conference call guidelines: I would also like to ask everyone to follow a few guidelines. The conference call will be a maximum of 45 minutes. We will begin with business highlights from Mr. James Mack and then a question-and-answer session. We request that you ask one question at a time, but we will honor the request for one clarification if required. This will provide access to everyone's question. An instant replay of the conference call will be available at approximately 12 noon today, Wednesday, October 25, through the end of business, Friday, October 27 by calling 1-800-570-8791 for domestic calls and 1-402-344-6824 for international.

Now, let me turn the meeting over to Jim Mack, Cambrex's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I'm also joined today by Claes Glassell, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll spend a few minutes to discuss some highlights from the quarter and then we'll open it up to Q&A. As you saw from the press release, we had record earnings in the third quarter, up over 16% from the prior year and we are very pleased with this performance. This is an impressive accomplishment since as most of you know this is typically a soft quarter for us, and in addition, this year we had several external factors negatively impacting top-line growth and profitability. The weak euro had two effects; first, a negative impact on European sales when converted back to a US-dollar basis; and secondly, it allowed European competitors a significant advantage on price. We faced an aggressive pricing situation from competition on several active pharmaceutical ingredients in the area of ulcerative colitis, in animal health products and an x-ray contrast media product. In addition, the currency translation in the human health sector impacted the growth about 6%. In animal health/ag and specialty segments, we experienced significant increases in raw material and energy costs as we had discussed a few weeks ago. The changes in raw material prices in the third quarter alone cost us about $2 million, pre-tax. While we continue to pass these cost increases through, there have been some lags due to price protection and terms and we expect to recover most of these early in 2001. While the human health segment sales are typically lumpy quarter-to-quarter, the combined effect of the euro, some postponed orders and the continued shift to higher-margin products continued to lower the sales number; in particular, we had two customers delay their NDA submissions into next year, we had one customer with process validation changes to complete, and a couple had inventory overstocks. Finally in the bioscience segment, we had supply problems as we had mentioned before on two cell types resulting in a million dollar shortfall in the third quarter. These sourcing problems should be resolved by year-end. On the up side, if we exclude these two products with supply problems from the base business, the balance of the normal human cell lines achieved a 17% increase in sales. So, that good performance was masked by a couple of problems there. We will now open it up for questions. Maureen, if we could proceed with that?

Good morning everyone. As the operator noted, I am Doug MacMillan, Cambrex's Chief Financial Officer.

This will provide access to everyone's questions. I also note that the – there will be an instant replay of the conference call available at approximately 12 noon today and will be available through the end of business as of Friday, January 26, by calling 1-800-704-0508 for domestic calls, and 1-402-220-0326 for international. The webcast is also accessible on our website www.cambrex.com. Now, let me turn the meeting over to Jim Mack, Cambrex's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to spend a few minutes to discuss a few highlights from the fourth quarter, the full year, and few comments on the 2001 outlook. First of all, we are pleased with the fourth quarter profitability as we were able achieve a bottom line above expectations in a difficult environment. This is particularly impressive in light of an exceptionally strong fourth quarter last year in 1999, which did include some Y2K pre-buying even though some of our customers deny that was happening. As we anticipated, in September, we also incurred rising feedstock prices, energy prices, and some currency effects that all negatively impacted both top line sales and profitability. Also, the Y2K buy-in had the additional effect as this stock piling pulled down some of the demand in the year – throughout year 2000. We shipped over 25 new products for the first time in the fourth quarter and continued to make strong progress in the problem areas we discussed last quarter. We set the stage for growth in 2001 with new product sales of products introduced last year of nearly $20 million. And we expect to build on this foundation throughout 2001. In human health, reported gross sales increased 2.4% versus 1999. However, adding back the currency translations effect of about 6.3% puts us at an increase of 8.7, which is at the low end of our target growth range. However, if we normalize for the Y2K impact of almost $2.5 million, this would place us at the upper end of the growth range of close to or over 12%. While we continue to walk away from low-margin business, this should have a considerable less impact in 2001. At the same time, however, as the euro continues to strengthen, we are recovering previously lost business. We are building our innovative pharmaceutical business with a strong pipeline of new products, our development facilities are full through the first quarter and well in to the second quarter. To provide us with additional capabilities as we had previously announced, we have completed and occupied our Cambrex Technical Center of Excellence, and the new facility will be a hub for all of our life science product process development. We have completed an expansion of a new product facility in Charles City, Iowa, and we have built a new larger laboratory in Italy. In our generic business, we introduced 11 new products in 2000 including a wide range covering antivirals, tranquilizers, beta-blockers, colitis treatments, antihistamines, antibacterials and ADHD therapeutics. We have a significant backlog for production well in to the second quarter. We have expanded our geographic marketing territories as a demand for generic pharmaceuticals continues to spread to countries including Brazil, Poland, Turkey, Russia, as well as other countries in Asia. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced an equity investment and technical collaboration with Synthon Chiragenics. This collaboration includes a manufacturing agreement under which we have already shipped product and technical collaboration to leverage Synthon's and Cambrex's chiral technologies. We have been working with Synthon for over 2 years. In the fourth quarter, we scaled up one new pharma product to metric ton quantities. and I expect to see multimillion-dollar revenues from this relationship. In the bioscience area, we have grown 14.7 year-over-year and continue to push margins up. They are now 52.8% up from 50.2% in 1999. While sales are down for the quarter, low-margin serum and diagnostic products are entirely responsible. Our higher growth and higher margin product lines remain very healthy. We have reorganized the bioscience business into two global business units, the bio-research and bio-therapeutic business units. This organization, based on managing from end markets and customers back into the company, will enhance our entire supply chain performance. We will be able to focus on new technologies to speed new products to the marketplace. Coincident with the new structure, we have put several new seasoned bioscience executives in place. We are solving our sourcing problems and at the same time we are implementing our new information system and business processes. We see a multitude of opportunities on the horizon to leverage and integrate our technologies across multiple platforms. Already we have seen the benefits from this global business alignment in our LAL tox testing product line that finished the year on a very strong note and has a lot of new product momentum going into 2001. Cell therapy continues to be a strategic long-term growth area for the bioscience unit. We have an agreement with a company and are making a product for late clinical Phase II trials for a cell-based therapeutic. Cell-based assays are also a high priority. Market segment growths are expected to exceed 50% per year and we have continued to put more resources in place such as the acquisition of LumiTech, to build a multimillion dollar business within the next 3 years. Finally, for the year 2001, Cambrex continues to target sales revenue growth at the 12-15% for bioscience segment and 10% to12% in human health. New technology and product such as cells and media for cell-therapy bioassays, new cell systems will all but fuel and build our growth. The generic pharma demand will continue to expand geographically, and the increasing number of drugs coming off patent will increase further, yielding generic API growth. We also expect to enter the manufacturing of generic biopharmaceuticals. To use a sailing term, I feel the wind is now at our back. Raw materials costs are declining, energy costs are trending down, the euro is strengthening and the resolution of some of our raw material supply problems are being taken care of. I think we really are at the low point in the specialty chemical cycle and we look for an excellent and exciting 2001 in sales, net income and further repositioning the Company into the life science arena. Operator, we could now open it up for Q&A.

We also expect to enter the manufacturing of generic biopharmaceuticals. In selling term, I feel the wind is now at our back. Raw material costs are declining, energy costs are trending down, the euro is strengthening and the resolution of some of our raw material supply problems are being taken care of. I think we are very at the low point in the specialty chemical cycle and we look for an excellent and exciting 2001 in sales, net income and further reposition the company in the life science arena. Operator, we could now open it up for Q&A.

The webcast is also accessible on our website www.cambrex.com. Now, let me turn the meeting over to Jim Mack, Cambrex's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to spend a few minutes to discuss a few highlights from the fourth quarter, the full year, and few comments on the 2001 outlook. First of all, we are pleased with the fourth quarter profitability as we were able achieve a bottom line above expectations in a difficult environment. This is particularly impressive in light of an exceptionally strong fourth quarter last year in 1999, which did include some Y2K pre-buying even though some of our customers deny that was happening. As we anticipated, in September, we also incurred rising feedstock prices, energy prices, and some currency effects that all negatively impacted both top line sales and profitability. Also, the Y2K buy-in had the additional effect as this stock piling pulled down some of the demand in the year – throughout year 2000. We shipped over 25 new products for the first time in the fourth quarter and continued to make strong progress in the problem areas we discussed last quarter. We set the stage for growth in 2001 with new product sales of products introduced last year of nearly $20 million. And we expect to build on this foundation throughout 2001. In human health, reported gross sales increased 2.4% versus 1999. However, adding back the currency translations effect of about 6.3% puts us at an increase of 8.7, which is at the low end of our target growth range. However, if we normalize for the Y2K impact of almost $2.5 million, this would place us at the upper end of the growth range of close to or over 12%. While we continue to walk away from low-margin business, this should have a considerable less impact in 2001. At the same time, however, as the euro continues to strengthen, we are recovering previously lost business. We are building our innovative pharmaceutical business with a strong pipeline of new products, our development facilities are full through the first quarter and well in to the second quarter. To provide us with additional capabilities as we had previously announced, we have completed and occupied our Cambrex Technical Center of Excellence, and the new facility will be a hub for all of our life science product process development. We have completed an expansion of a new product facility in Charles City, Iowa, and we have built a new larger laboratory in Italy. In our generic business, we introduced 11 new products in 2000 including a wide range covering antivirals, tranquilizers, beta-blockers, colitis treatments, antihistamines, antibacterials and ADHD therapeutics. We have a significant backlog for production well in to the second quarter. We have expanded our geographic marketing territories as a demand for generic pharmaceuticals continues to spread to countries including Brazil, Poland, Turkey, Russia, as well as other countries in Asia. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced an equity investment and technical collaboration with Synthon Chiragenics. This collaboration includes a manufacturing agreement under which we have already shipped product and technical collaboration to leverage Synthon's and Cambrex's chiral technologies. We have been working with Synthon for over 2 years. In the fourth quarter, we scaled up one new pharma product to metric ton quantities. and I expect to see multimillion-dollar revenues from this relationship. In the bioscience area, we have grown 14.7 year-over-year and continue to push margins up. They are now 52.8% up from 50.2% in 1999. While sales are down for the quarter, low-margin serum and diagnostic products are entirely responsible. Our higher growth and higher margin product lines remain very healthy. We have reorganized the bioscience business into two global business units, the bio-research and bio-therapeutic business units. This organization, based on managing from end markets and customers back into the company, will enhance our entire supply chain performance. We will be able to focus on new technologies to speed new products to the marketplace. Coincident with the new structure, we have put several new seasoned bioscience executives in place. We are solving our sourcing problems and at the same time we are implementing our new information system and business processes. We see a multitude of opportunities on the horizon to leverage and integrate our technologies across multiple platforms. Already we have seen the benefits from this global business alignment in our LAL tox testing product line that finished the year on a very strong note and has a lot of new product momentum going into 2001. Cell therapy continues to be a strategic long-term growth area for the bioscience unit. We have an agreement with a company and are making a product for late clinical Phase II trials for a cell-based therapeutic. Cell-based assays are also a high priority. Market segment growths are expected to exceed 50% per year and we have continued to put more resources in place such as the acquisition of LumiTech, to build a multimillion dollar business within the next 3 years. Finally, for the year 2001, Cambrex continues to target sales revenue growth at the 12-15% for bioscience segment and 10% to12% in human health. New technology and product such as cells and media for cell-therapy bioassays, new cell systems will all but fuel and build our growth. The generic pharma demand will continue to expand geographically, and the increasing number of drugs coming off patent will increase further, yielding generic API growth. We also expect to enter the manufacturing of generic biopharmaceuticals. To use a sailing term, I feel the wind is now at our back. Raw materials costs are declining, energy costs are trending down, the euro is strengthening and the resolution of some of our raw material supply problems are being taken care of. I think we really are at the low point in the specialty chemical cycle and we look for an excellent and exciting 2001 in sales, net income and further repositioning the Company into the life science arena. Operator, we could now open it up for Q&A.
Welcome. I'm Doug MacMillan, Cambrex's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I just want to remind everyone that the conference call is held today under the terms of the Safe Harbor disclaimer. That disclaimer says, "The following discussion may contain certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements with the Securities & Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor provision, under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and Rule 3B-6 under the Exchange Act.

The webcast is also accessible from our website, "www.cambrex.com." Now, let me turn the meeting over to Jim Mack. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. I want to spend a few minutes to discuss some highlights from the first quarter and the 2001 outlook. I know many of you have other calls; so we will get to the Q&A in just a few minutes. We're very pleased with our first quarter profitability. Net income increased almost 17%, and EPS increased 14.5% compared to first quarter last year. This came from the combined effect of top line growth in our life science segments, continuing margin improvement, and reduced interest and tax rates. Compared to fourth quarter 2000, the improvement is even more dramatic. The bioscience segment started the year strong with sales growth of 8.4%; and when we account for currency impact, the sales growth was about 10%. The increase came, predominantly, from the sales of cell systems, media, and LAL endotoxin products to markets where we already have a very strong position. Last year, we organized our bioscience segments into two global business groups, biotherapeutic and bioresearch. The combination of talented new management and an organization structured to enhance our customer focus is the catalyst for that double-digit growth. We've also put behind us, the LAL stopper problem that caused shortages of supply last year, and one of the two cell source problems – both of which we discussed in the fourth quarter. Backlogs were resolved in mid-quarter this year. In the Human Health segment, we also started the year well with top line sales of 5.8 over last year first quarter. When we account for currency, sales growth is closer to 8.5%. Growth in this sector continues to come from new products and markets, including for instance, the intermediate for Genzyme, GelTex's Renagel, a new contact lens polymer, and several central nervous system cardiovascular therapeutics, plus geographic expansion of many of our generic APIs or active pharmaceutical ingredients. A continued weakness in the euro has permitted some European competitors to snipe at a couple of our older products. Sales of animal health and ag products are up, due to order timing and weak sales in the first quarter of last year, caused by the plant outage we had. We continue to see energy in feedstock cost pressure profitability in this segment; although, we expect to see these moderate later in the year. Natural gas energy costs in the animal health, ag and specialty operations cost us about $1 million more this year first quarter compared to last year first quarter. As you can see, specialty chemicals, fine chemicals are experiencing slowness in products sold into those segments of coatings, photographic, plastics, telecommunication markets, as a result of a general slowdown in those industrial markets. This segment also includes products that we have dropped. Offsetting that, we shipped over 11 new products in the first quarter; and all of our development facilities are booked well into the third quarter. On Thursday of this week, we have our board of directors' meetings; and one of the topics are expansion of our labs, a Phase-II expansion in our tech center as well as expansions in our pilot plant facilities. As we look out for full 2001, as most of you know, overall, our internal growth rates and targets are 10 to 12% top line for Human Health, 12 to 15% for bioscience, and earnings growth of 15% or greater. We continue to make progress on repositioning the company to the life science markets. Top line growth will be driven by new products and services to accelerate the drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes, including biomanufacturing – anything we can do to help our customers to get therapeutics to patients faster. Targeted growth areas include our cells and media for research in biotherapeutics, human cell based bioassays for lead optimization, ADME, COX studies, LAL endotoxin products, global expansion of both the generic market and our niche generic product portfolio, combined with broader partnerships with innovative pharmaceutical customers. Investments in R&D will continue to be a priority and fuel organic growth. Everything we do is connected to a unique technology platform and to technical capabilities. Lastly, I just want to mention, we announced in March, that Doug, our CFO, will retire at the end of May. Sal Guccione, currently Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, will be replacing Doug; and Sal is here today to join us for the Q&A, as is Claes Glassell, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Operator, we will now open the call for Q&A.
Okay, good morning. This is Sal Guccione. Before we get started, you know, before I turn over to Jim, I would just like to say a couple of words. I'd like to welcome you all to Cambrex's second quarter 2001 earnings conference call. I am Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And before we begin I would like to remind every everyone that the conference call today is held today is held under terms of the Safe Harbor Disclaimer. That disclaimer covers the fact that the discussion might contain content that constitutes forward-looking statements within the Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and Rule 3B-6 under The Exchange Act. Although such statements represent management's best judgment as of today, such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. The conference call will last about 45 minutes. We will begin with business highlights from Jim Mack, followed by a question-and-answer session. We request that you ask one question at a time, but we will honor the request for one clarification if required. A replay of the conference call will be available beginning at noon today through the end of the business day Friday, July 27, by calling 1-800-566-0682 for domestic and 1-402-998-0817 for international. A webcast is also available on our website www.cambrex.com. Please click on the Investor Relations button for that. With that, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Jim Mack, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Okay, thank you Sal. I think we are both recovering from 2- or 3-week head colds, so I apologize for how irritable that can be. Well, it was not an easy quarter for those of you that have seen our press release and it's mostly driven by dramatic slowdown in sales in our Animal Health/Ag,. Specialty, Fine Chemical sectors, in addition to lower demand and some of our customers I think were working off excess inventory. Also, we continue to have a reactor problem at one of our facilities which results in higher costs from lower throughput and poor yield. In addition, it causes shortage of product that we could sell if we had it. And like everyone else, we were impacted by foreign exchange, although that will become less and less of a factor going forward. The areas where we have been investing held up quite well, specifically Human Health and Bioscience. In the Human Health area, we continue to see a robust pipeline of new projects with big pharma and emerging innovators; actually, our second quarter revenue from these projects more than doubled compared to Q2 of last year. Sales continue to increase from products like Genzyme's Renagel, therapeutics for coronary disease, high blood pressure, cancer products, and diabetes. We have also seen, like others, some delays caused by the FDA postponing approvals. There are actually two of them mentioned in the Wall Street Journal today and it seems to becoming a more common occurrence, and as we've reported before, the weak euro does put price pressure on some of our older products, pulling down our sales growth. Now, in the Bioscience area, sales were up 12.8% or close to 14% when adjusted for foreign exchange and we'll get into the details on that. The acquisition of Bio Science accounted for about half of the improvement and we'll talk about some of the things going on in the base business. We did have very strong performance in our cells, in media and our endotoxin detection products. Also new products helped out quite a bit with several new cell systems, for instance Caco-2 cells that are used in new drug screening, Chondrocytes, which are cartilage, adipocyte or fat cells, and adult stem cells continue to do well. In addition, we introduced 3 new cell-based bioassays; ReportaLight, which is a reporter gene assay; ViaLight MDA, which is a chemiluminescence test for microbial detection; and a new ELISA or enzyme-linked assay for adipocytes or fat cells. Cell therapy is a new emerging technology as many of you know, and is a very strategic area for Cambrex's future growth, and we've started supply services for two new cell therapy applications. While we do keep a tight control on costs and spending, we have had some lay offs. It has also been a good environment to add key R&D and sales people, mainly to fill open positions. In the last 12 months, we've added 20 people to R&D and 10 people to sales and marketing, and these are cost increases we have to take on in advance of increased sales. The openings are largely filled although we will add people from time to time to support many of these new growth programs as needed. As we look ahead, we actually have to look back a little bit. Internally, we said to ourselves last September, we are entering in an industrial and manufacturing recession and demand in these traditional specialty fine chemical areas will continue to be weak, we think probably well into next year and some of this is caused by – pardon me – over-correction in our customers' inventory. We think we have seen really the worst of the contraction. Having said that, we are very excited about our prospects in the API or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients manufacturing arena both for small molecules and for bio-therapeutics. We see very strong demand for these APIs from generic pharmaceutical companies, from big pharma, for products for clinical trials, and emerging pharma for both small molecules and the bio-therapeutics. Also contract R&D for supply of small quantities and for process development remains quite strong. To support this growth we have been investing in high return on investment projects and we are presenting to the Board of Directors this Thursday two main projects. The first is to add cGMP capacity at Charles City, Iowa for the manufacturing of controlled substances. As we reported earlier, we have put in place all the DEA security requirements and procedures and these have been installed and approved. The active ingredients have been made in our general purpose cGMP pilot plant. This new investment will give us dedicated facilities for making the controlled substances and this will be in place by third quarter next year. Secondly, we are expanding a key process bottleneck in our LAL endotoxin detection manufacturing. This will be expanded by a factor of two and will be on stream by third quarter of next year. Beyond that we are doing other upgrades in our R&D labs. For instance in Sweden, we have a 3-phase upgrade process going on. We are already well into phase I and we are adding capabilities at our new tech center here in New Jersey. Lastly as most of you know, we are adding capacity at our new Bio Science contract manufacturing facility in Baltimore. Suite five will be on stream in September this year and suite six by perhaps October, November of 2002. Lastly, I would just like to say as we look ahead here I believe given the continued drag on earnings from our older businesses, we'll probably end up the year with an earnings improvement in the range of 8-10% compared to last year and versus our 5-year performance of 16.7%. However, with the new product growth, we've already seen for next year, we expect the earnings to return to above 15% growth in 2002. Okay. Jeffrey, I think we can open it up for Q&A.
Okay, actually this is Sal Guccione, Chief Financial Officer of Cambrex, I am joined here by Jim Mack, our Chairman and CEO as well as Claes Glassell our Chief Operating Officer and President. Before we begin, I just want to remind us some rules of the conference call. The call is being held under Safe Harbor disclaimer which states that some discussion might contain context that constitutes forward-looking statements within the SEC Safe Harbor Provision under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and rule 3B-6 under The Exchange Act. Although such statements represent managements' best judgment as of today and on information currently available, such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. The conference call will last about 45 minutes. It will begin with an introductory statement from Mr. Jim Mack followed by a question and answer session. We request that you ask 1 question at a time though we will honor the request for one clarification. A replay of the conference call will be available at approximately 4:30 pm, today, Wednesday, September 26, through the end of the business day Friday, September 28 by calling 800-947-6755 for domestic, and 1-402-220-4617 for international. The webcast is also accessible from our website www.cambrex.com. Please click on the investor relations button. Now, let me turn the meeting over to Jim Mack, Cambrex Chairman and CEO. Okay, Sal, thanks. Good afternoon. Well, as you know, we issued a press release this morning warning of an earnings shortfall versus analysts' consensus numbers. Analysts that have followed us for a while know that our Q3 is our lowest quarter usually during the year, given our Q3 vacation shutdowns. In order to make our Q3 results, we depend on having a very strong performance during September. And, although at this point we have preliminary data only, we did not see September materializing as previously expected. The economy really continued to deteriorate over the quarter and was further compounded with the attacks on New York City and the Pentagon on September 11th. Some of you have been here, you know that we look over the New York skyline and many of our headquarters employees watched this horror on September 11th. So, we understand the impact on everyone and on every business in this country and we realize that business has changed quite dramatically. Forecasts that we had been using no longer apply, we've been rechecking, re-forecasting, and we've been working very hard to get under the numbers and to get a foundation, the result of which caused us to issue this release this morning. And, I have been around for a number of economic cycles and I have not seen conditions this severe since 1974, except, I think, this time it happened a lot more suddenly. Following September 11th, the order flow really slowed at several locations and, in fact, stopped for a few days at others. And where we had orders and products ready for air shipments, these were delayed specifically in overseas generic active pharmaceutical ingredient shipments and others in biotechnology such as live cells. In other cases, some customers' routine tests were halted affecting our reagent sales. Some of this business will be picked up in Q4, but some of it is lost entirely. Beyond this, we have been building some inventory as a strike contingency at 2 locations. These contracts have been settled and we will correct these levels of inventory over the next quarter or two, but this will affect operating rates and some fixed cost absorption. Regarding Q4, we are taking a cautious approach. Information and forecasts are unreliable at this point, and customers themselves are being very conservative. And, as you know, there is a general uncertainty of what the economic climate will be over the next several months. Having said this, we expect revenue to improve in Q4, especially in our Bioscience and Human Health segments. At this point, we are somewhat uncertain about the exact mix in Human Health, so that's part of the reason we are being a little bit cautious, because we are not sure exactly today what the impact will be on margins. We continue to push very aggressively on cost containment with target savings of $10 million pre-tax for 2002, part of which will come from SG&A, some from discretionary spending, part from rationalization of poorly performing product lines and underutilized facilities. Based on what we can see, however, and from the specific actions we are taking, from new products that we know are growing, other products that have good growth prospects, we are expecting a good year in 2002. We expect our Life Science business to continue to strengthen and that together with the cost reductions I mentioned and with only minimum improvement in our Specialty and Fine Chemicals, for instance energy and raw materials which are already coming down, we should reach double-digit growth in earnings for 2002, even excluding the effects of FAS 142 on goodwill amortization accounting. Lastly, I would just like to say, at a Board meeting last week the Board formally approved proceeding with a new line of credit for at least $400 million and, at the same time, reaffirmed management's authority to repurchase up to 1 million shares of Cambrex stock. Having said that, I think we can now, operator, open the floor for questions.

Thank you. Good morning. Well, first off, I would like to thank Bill Plovanic and the organizers of the conference for giving me the opportunity to come here and talk to you about Anika today. For those of you who follow the Anika for the past several years, you know that there has been some very significant exciting developments over the last several months, specifically the acquisition of Fidia Advanced Biomaterials. Now, looks like I'm in a minority, but no presentation, at least, by Anika would be complete without the obligatory Safe Harbor statement. So, I would direct you to this and please consider any forward-looking statements we might make today and the presentation within this context and also, within the context of our SEC filings. So, who and what is Anika? We are a medical products company, publicly traded and both in the United States and also, in Italy and are now FAB subsidiary. We have over 20 years working with the naturally occurring biomolecule called hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid and today I would refer to it as HA. I think it's fair to say that both FAB and Anika are recognized as innovative developers of very differentiated products. Those products cover several medical disciplines, which are orthopedics, joint health, advanced wound care, ophthalmology, veterinary medicine, general surgical applications, and aesthetic dermatology. I also believe that it's recognized that Anika is a high quality and innovative manufacturer of these products. So, in its stage of development for Anika Therapeutics, why the FAB acquisition? Well, the simple answer is technology and an expanded product portfolio. There is a lot more. From a technology perspective, there's two very well patent protected and powerful basic technologies in FAB, HYAFF, ATP, and I'll talk a little bit about those in just a minute. Within Anika, we've talked quite some time about expanding and developing a commercialization office in Europe, and the FAB location in Italy, as well as the commercialized staff there fulfills that goal very nicely. From a human capital perspective, the combination of the two organizations; one a little more focused on research, the other one a little more focused on development, is very additive. And then finally, the product portfolio, the technology and also, the research programs are very additive, a lot more than you would think at first glance. So let's talk a little about HYAFF technology success. Essentially, what it does is react the HA molecule such that the hyaluronan then is insoluble. This allows the processing of that material in solid forms to make fiber, films, sponges, tubes, even microspheres. A good portion of the products to-date are woven and non-woven meshes of HA using what amounts to fairly standard textile technology. However, moving forward, you can see that there could be a potential myriad of applications for this technology both with HA alone and also, with HA in combination with other biomaterials or pharmacologically active entities. I'll skip over this slide in the interest of time. The second basic technology that we acquired in the FAB acquisition was autocrosslinked polymerization, which produces a very viscous HA gel. I would also point out to you that Anika itself has a crosslink technology, and that's the basis of our MONOVISC, INCERT, and ELEVESS and HYDRELLE, product franchises. Actually, it's very powerful now for us to have a combination of chemical modification technologies that give us a very good leg up on being able to solve a lot of these thorny formulation problems as we develop new products. So a word about the vision of Anika now with the FAB acquisition. We see ourselves as inventors, developers, and commercializing agent for innovative therapeutic products for tissue protection, healing, and repair. Moving forward, our primary areas of focus are going to be in joint health and orthopedics, advanced wound care and surgical applications, and our paradigm is to cover the continuum of patient care from palliative to protective to restorative. Let's switch gears a little bit and look at some of the revenue growth in Anika, not including FAB. I apologize, these are nine months' data for three years. We'll be announcing our Q4 and year-end results next week, so it wasn't possible to present some that view today. Two things to note, first of all, you can see that tiny yellow dusting on the top, that represents our aesthetic dermatology products. I think there is some significant upside for the company there, as that product gets adopted and as we expand our distribution worldwide, but you can see a main driver of certainly Anika revenues has been in the joint health area, and that will continue to be the case in the near future. When I say joint health, I am mostly talking about products to treat osteoarthritis called viscosupplementation products, injections of hyaluronic acid. You can see here that there is a substantial market worldwide, that market is growing, and if we take just a look at the U.S., the single largest market, there are probably about six products currently approved for sale in the United States. Most of the products are all targeting six months of pain relief in their multiple injection products. So, ORTHOVISC, our product, marketed by DePuy Mitek and Genzyme's product of SYNVISC our three-injection regimen. The rest of the products here have tried to accomplish the same goal with a five-injection regimen. There is one single injection product here, it's called SYNVISC-One, and it was released several months ago, and it's starting to make quite an impact in the marketplace. We move forward to 2012, and when we look at Anika projections, what we see are two things. One, we believe that the market is shifting to a single injection product. We also believe that there will be a place for multiple injection products, but it would seem that the five injection products may lose some of their luster unless they have efficacy, safety or real cost gain implication. This shift to single-injection products puts us in pretty good stead in the Anika, in that we have a product called MONOVISC, which is receiving pretty good attention over in Europe, and recently in Canada. The status of that product in the United States is that we are moving through the PMA process with the FDA. We took a modular approach. We submitted our clinical module at the end of last year, and we expect that that we will get approval in the third quarter of this year. Let's take a look at some of the milestones we achieved with our joint health franchise, good revenue growth. We talked about our progress with MONOVISC. I would bring your attention to one other point. We have a third generation product in development, it's called CINGAL. It's HA with an active therapeutic molecule incorporated. We had intended to bring that into the clinic by the end of last year. We ran into some minor technical problems, but most importantly, a major distraction with regard to the FAB acquisition. So we're still moving forward with that product so as you rationalize our total product portfolio, maybe not on the same original schedule that we intended. If we take a long-term view, there is couple of important things that we should talk about here. First, it is our intent to take MONOVISC and directly commercialize it in the United States with our own sales force. We would add in relevant FAB products as they get approved in the United States, and put those also in a bag of the same people. FAB has been very successful in developing some cartilage generation products which are only available in Europe, and these are the Hyalograft C and HyaloFAS products mentioned here. Our long-term strategy for those products right now is currently being developed. It's not totally clear what will be required to bring them to the United States at this juncture. In Abano Terme, Italy, where FAB is located, there is a pretty sophisticated cell biology and cell processing facility. And in that facility, the so-called tissue test products are made. There are three products that use the polygase cells; the first being Hyalograft C, which incorporates the chondrocytes into a HYAFF matrix; and the other two, Laserskin autograft and Hyalograft-3D matrix, incorporates keratinocytes and fiber black into the same HYAFF matrix. And these are for wound care applications, and I'll talk a little bit about those in a second. Looking at Hyalograft C, a number of patients have been implanted and followed up for a fairly significant period of time with excellent results. I really don't have time to go into any of those results here in the presentation today, but this has been a very successful product to-date. This essentially shows the process that's used, a biopsy is taken, cells are isolated, concentrated, seated on the matrix. The matrix is developed and then implanted back within 30 days. So, it's a two-step surgical process. Another product in the portfolio, a more recent product that's just been CE marked is something called HyaloFAS. And in essence, this is a one-step surgery product. And here you see the HyaloFAS matrix as made and then ready for implantation. I'll let you read this slide, but essentially HyaloFAS takes bone marrow acid MSDs incorporated therein and incorporates them into a HYAFF matrix in one-step process. Rationale for HyaloFAS is listed here. One thing I want to point out, because we've spent a fair amount of time in FAB developing treatment regimen and paradigm for looking at repairing cartilage lesions, and so on, and so forth. So, the existence of HyaloFAS and Hyalograft C. They're really complementary. They are used to treat three different size defects. We think that is very comprehensive portfolio that we have here for cartilage repair. Moving on to advanced wound care, we really don't have a lot of time to spend here. The takeaway is that it's a fairly extensive portfolio of products that treat various aspects of complex wounds. What I am going to focus on are the top of the pyramid, here is some of the skin substitutes. I mentioned Hyalograft 3D autograft. This is the HYAFF matrix that's seated with the fiberglass, if you see the matrix and how the cell's attachment progresses. The other product in this portfolio is the Laserskin autograft. Again, HYAFF matrix this, time seeded again high metrics time and then there is silicon layer placed on top. So, this is the outer layer, you can use this if you have an adequate wound bed, if not, you would use both products in combination. The autograft initially and then this one-time cost. This cartoon here depicts how these products are made, essentially starts with the biopsy, various cell sites are separated. Again, it's similar to the Hyalograft C. You move this through, concentrate the cells, seed the cells on the matrix, and then return it back to the doctor for implantation in the patient. I will skip over this, but this gives you an idea the portfolio of products at FAB. I do want to mention a few other products, commercial products, and then one program that's in development. Hyalobarrier gel is a post-op adhesion prevention product used in general in pelvic surgery. There is a large, large amount of clinical data available for this product. It's been quite successful in Europe. It's starting to make headway with revenues in Asia. And we're evaluating what it would take to bring this product to United States, most likely a randomized clinical trial. The other item of note on this particular slide is Hyalospine. It's used to prevent postoperative adhesions after spinal surgery. There are several products currently on the market. This one is quite different and it takes a very innovative approach. Status of this is it's through basic preclinical, and we are in a pilot study right now with this product in Europe. Let's move now to a little bit of financial data. Revenue as we've seen before, nice growth. We've been able to grow gross margins reasonably well. On the bottom line, EPS has shown some growth, certainly not what a lot of our investors expect. One of the issues that has had an impact on our EPS growth has been the construction of the new manufacturing plant and corporate center. We built that in Bedford, Massachusetts, and we're in the process now of validating that and we'll soon move into garnering FDA approval. Running through facilities has really been somewhat expensive. There is no other way that we would have done it. We need the capacity and the automation that we've built into that new plant, and we also plan on transferring a lot of the Fidia Advanced Biomaterials over to the U.S. for manufacture there. The balance sheet through nine months, once again, reasonable cash position even after the FAB acquisition and very little debt. We did acquire FAB at the end of last year, so the balance sheet that will be released here in a week will be considerably different from this one. So as we move forward through 2010, what are the main corporate goals that we hope to achieve? First and foremost, approval for MONOVISC in the United States; second, launch MONOVISC through our own commercialization arm again in the United States; continue the worldwide commercial expansion of ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC through our network of distribution partners and through additional and new regulatory approvals in new countries; fourth with the FAB acquisition and integration, there are several tasks there, but we're well on our way and we've been into about 2.5 months; fifth, achieving our final regulatory approval and full manufacturing status in our new plant Bedford, Massachusetts and then finally, increase – continue to increase our revenue growth and maintain profitability, that is at least at the levels of 2009 and hopefully reaching from there. Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you, Steinar. As Steinar mentioned, Atea had strong growth in operating profit in the third quarter of 2017 based on higher sales of services and improved gross margin. Performance in Norway, Sweden and Finland was particularly strong. Total revenue in Q3 was NOK 6.7 billion, up 3.9% from last year. Currency movements had a positive effect of 0.9% on group revenue in the third quarter. Growth in revenue was driven by higher sales of services which were up by 8.6% and software, which was up by 21.3%. This offsets slightly lower sales of hardware, which fell by 1.5%. Total gross margin increased to 24.2%, up from 23.5% last year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by a higher proportion of services in the revenue mix. Based on increased revenue and improved gross margin, EBITDA grew by 14.8% to NOK 269 million. Finally, depreciation and amortization costs fell by 8.7% from last year. This was primarily due to lower capital expenditure during the last two years. With improved capital efficiency, Atea's EBIT grew by 34.5% to NOK 176 million. We'll now take a closer look at revenue and profit development across the countries in which we operate. Starting with Norway, which had a sharp increase in profitability in the third quarter. Total revenue grew by 5.3% to NOK 1.9 billion. Product revenue was up by 4.9%, driven by higher sales of client-related software. Services revenue was up by 6.5% based on growth in long-term service contracts such as outsourcing and support agreements. Gross margin increased slightly to 24.4% compared with 24.2% last year. The increase in gross margin was based on higher sales of Atea's own services as a proportion of the revenue mix. Personnel and other operating expenses were flat from last year as a result of lower head count. During the third quarter, Atea had 33 fewer full-time employees in Norway compared with last year. Based on higher service revenue and lower head count, EBITDA in Norway grew by 33.5% from last year to NOK 79 million. We'll now move on to Sweden where our business also had solid growth in revenue and profitability. Total revenue in Sweden grew by 5.0% to SEK 2.6 billion. Product sales grew by 3.7% compared with last year, driven by higher demand from public sector customers. Services revenue grew by 11% from last year, with higher sales of both consulting and contracted services. At the same time, gross margin increased significantly to 23% compared with 21.8% last year. This increase in gross margin was based on higher hardware margins and increased sales of Atea's own services as a proportion of the revenue mix. With solid revenue growth and improved gross margin, Sweden's EBITDA grew by 19.5% to SEK 102 million. Continuing on to Denmark. In Denmark, Atea reported lower sales, but also lower operating expenses from last year. EBITDA was slightly down, but EBIT was up from last year. Total revenue fell by 4.4% in the third quarter to DKK 1.3 billion. Product revenue was down by 7.9% from a strong comparable period last year. In Q3 last year, product revenue grew by 10.4% based on large project rollouts within client and audio/video solutions. Services revenue increased by 5.9% based on higher sales of contracted services. Total gross margin improved slightly to 24.5% in the third quarter compared to 24.4% last year, reflecting more services in the revenue mix. During the last two quarters, Atea has taken steps to reduce staffing levels in Denmark in response to lower sales. Since March 2017, the number of full-time employees in Denmark has fallen by nearly 80. In Q3, the average number of full-time employees in Denmark was 1.9% below the same quarter last year. In addition, the business has greatly reduced its capital expenditure during the last year. As a result, depreciation costs fell by 12.8% in Denmark compared with last year. With lower operating expenses offsetting lower revenue, EBITDA was DKK 57 million in Q3 2017 compared with DKK 61 million last year. EBIT in Denmark increased from DKK 17 million to DKK 19 million as a result of lower depreciation costs. This is ahead of the guidance given at the last quarterly presentation. In Finland, our business continued to show excellent growth in both revenue and profitability as it has throughout 2017. Total revenue grew by 16.9% to €44 million. Product sales grew by 14.3% based on higher demand for client hardware, particularly within new public sector frame agreements. Services revenue was up 33% based on higher sales of software consultants and large project implementations. Gross margins increased to 19% from 18.1% last year because of a higher proportion of services and the revenue mix. With higher revenue and gross margin, EBITDA grew to €0.6 million compared with minus €0.1 million last year. Finally, Atea Baltics had lower revenue and profitability in the third quarter. Total revenue was down by 2.1% to €24 million. Product revenue increased by 1% from last year, while services was down by 8.6% due to a large subcontracted project in the same quarter last year. Personnel and other operating expenses grew by 5.7% to €4.9 million. The increase was primarily due to salary inflation and a change in the employee mix toward more high-end consultants. With lower revenue and higher operating expenses, EBITDA was down by 19.7% from last year to €1.5 million. We need to put this in perspective: despite the decline, the EBITDA margin in the Baltics remained a healthy 6.2%. Finally, a word on our cash flow. Cash flow from operations was an inflow of NOK 189 million in Q3 2017 compared with an inflow of NOK 151 million last year. As you can see from this chart, Atea's operating cash flow is highly seasonal, peaking in Q4 and with negative cash flow in the first half of the year as working capital balances increased from a very low level at year end. Based on this seasonal pattern, Atea's aim throughout the year is to continuously improve its working capital balance from the same seasonal period last year. If Atea's working capital balance falls from the same period last year, then working capital will have a positive impact on our cash flow for the full year. At the end of Q3, Atea's net working capital balance remained at NOK 287 million below last year, reflecting higher days payables outstanding compared with last year. This concludes our summary of the third quarter financial results. I'll now pass back over the podium to Steinar to provide further information on profit improvement initiatives in Denmark and across our business going forward.
