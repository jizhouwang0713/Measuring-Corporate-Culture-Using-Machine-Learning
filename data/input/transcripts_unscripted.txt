[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Dawson with Lifetech Capital.Congratulations on the [indiscernible]. I have several questions here. The first is just a little bit more specificity on the dosing going forward for Menerba. Now that you've changed the manufacturing, you removed some of the fiber, your 10 grams per day now becomes 5 grams per day, is that correct?That is correct.Okay. So are we looking at -- in the tolerability study, are we now looking at 5 grams per day as well as 10 grams per day, which is equal to 10 and 20 in the Phase II trial, and on top of that, do we also have a 15 gram per day cohort?That is correct. We have a 10 gram, which is an equivalent of 20 and a 15 gram, which is an equivalent of 30.Okay. But you have applied [ph] the original efficacious dose in the Phase II of a 5 gram?Not at this time, noOkay. And then that will help shape how you do the Phase III trial going forward as far as dosing in that?That's correct.Okay, that's what I thought. The only other question I have is notice some of your capital constraints have been relieved. Are you planning on moving forward some of the other development programs, such as Bezielle or Seala?No, we're not. The money that we acquired is really sufficient to secure the development of Menerba but not sufficient to secure the development of the other 2 drugs. But we are engaged in discussions concerning these drug developments. But unfortunately, as Tom mentioned, we cannot really discuss this.Understandable. If I can just squeeze one last question in, as far as identifying clinical sites, you say you want to enroll another 20. What would that approximately take you to in total clinical sites for the Phase III trial?50.50. Okay. All right, guys, I'll hop back in the queue.Our next question comes from the line of Edward Nash with Cowen and Company.Great. What is the -- after you [ph] response the tolerability trial and the animal study, I know that you said there on the time line seems to be on the same track. Any idea when you think those will be completed? I know you said you had 3 sites set up for tolerability but just kind of curious when you think those might end?Both of them are in the second quarterOkay, okay. Great. So it's near term then. And additionally, I know I am not asking for a specific, just kind of maybe your thoughts on generally with regard to a partnership. Are you open to anything and everything? Is this something potentially you want to retain co-promote wise [ph] United States, or you just don't have any interest at all in getting in the valve [ph] in the sales force and you're looking for a worldwide partner, or keeping U.S. your partner and having an x U.S. different partner? I mean, kind of what are your thoughts in general?We are definitely relatively experienced R&D hub and not a marketing hub. But we're a bit agnostic in this particular time because we think that the most important thing is to advance the drug to a better chance to be approved sooner rather than later. And what we would like to retain in a lot of those discussion is the possibility to renegotiate. But at the moment, we are preferring a worldwide license deal with substantial company, but we're also discussing it with regional as well as specialty pharma.Okay, great. And just, sorry, one last question, I just wanted -- it seems to me now that you have a capital to be able to get a Phase III done, it seems like the safe thing for a partner to do would be one of [indiscernible] opt-in type of deal where they can actually wait and see the Phase III data first and then have the ability to opt in. Is that something that you're willing to consider as well?Yes. Definitely, I mean, in general, you probably know that better than me, the atmosphere of when and how pharma companies are negotiating their licensing deals has changed and pushed it more towards the end of development rather than early development. So we are negotiating all those profitability. Luckily, we're discussing with several potential partner that could advance the talks a little differently.Great, and congratulations. You're getting closer to that big event horizon in the Phase III.Great. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Andrew McDonald with LifeSci Advisors.I know you guys have been focused really on advancing into the pivotal Phase III studies. I guess my question has more to do with the market opportunity. I'd love to get your thoughts on what the market opportunity really is now, now that estrogen really isn't seeing the use it once was. And is that really the market opportunity or is it really beyond that?That's a great question, Andrew. Thank you. First of all, this is a growing population so when estrogen was at its peak, the number of women at menopausal age was approximately 27 million, 28 million. And because the baby boomers are now reaching this age and getting into this age, that population has actually soared. And worldwide, there is an aging population especially in the developing -- even in the developing markets, so that number will increase dramatically. So our baseline is much greater than ever in the history of estrogen therapy was available for them. Second to that, I think that it's clear and most important that the crucial element in providing therapy for this treatment -- of this symptom, is the safety of the drug. And so far, we have shown, what I would say, kind of like a stellar safety. And if that proceeds into approval with the same type of safety that we have seen so far in the human and animal studies, we can absolutely capture greater market than estrogen therapy ever had. The last thing is, estrogen is a very old therapy. It's over 60 years old. And the price that they could command is lower than a price that an ethical drug under patent can command, at least in the United States. So just by sheer price of a dose or per treatment, you can actually increase your market potential significantly. So just to give you an idea, if we penetrate, meaning if we capture approximately 2% of the U.S. market alone, we will be $1 billion drug, and that's very significant for any drug under development. We are granted the patents now in the U.S. and several countries that are signed to the PCT so we're protected in the majority of the world that is really a part of this market. And we definitely see a future once this drug is approved, there will be relatively quick penetration because there's really nothing out there that is competing with it that is significant to the treatment of hot flashes as well as shows the kind of safety that we show.Yes, I guess from a real simplistic point of view, I'd look at your sales of Premarin as being sort of a $2 billion drug. And if I'm not mistaken, there's still quite a lot of estrogen that is being sold in the United States. And I guess to your point, you're saying it's at a price that's lower than what you would typically expect for branded products?That's right. So the total sale of hormone therapy worldwide 2 years ago, which is the last data point we could obtain from IMS was $7.4 billion at the peak in 2002, and that's dropped by 40% since then. So it’s was about 5-point-something billion right now. Premarin was the best-selling drug, but it's really mainly the best-selling in the U.S. Other drugs in Europe, for instance, is 17beta estradiol that is the best selling. So the price per day for estrogen is about $1 a day. The price per day for most quality-of-life drugs that are under patent is approximately $5 a day, so that's a five-fold difference between Premarin and what Menerba could be. So if you just take the peak sales of Premarin when it was not marred by that many safety issues, but it already had safety concerns even at the time that the Women’s Health Initiative came out, we're talking about a potential market of $10 billion. But I think when you talk those numbers, people think that there is kind of like the company is drinking too much Coca-Cola with a lot of caffeine. But those are actually the numbers of approximately 20% of the women requiring treatment taking the treatment for at least one year. So I believe that we can definitely get to those numbers after a few years on the market.Right, I guess, to your point if in your Phase III study, you show a similar efficacy profile to what low-dose estrogen has historically shown, but you're not estrogen. You don't have the safety profile and the values of estrogen, why would a woman continue taking estrogen for her post-menopausal symptoms?From a patient point of view, definitely, if you compare the risk factor associated with hormone therapy and the risk factor that we currently know about Menerba, there is no reason that a woman ever should consider estrogen therapy. From a physician point of view, even worse because if Menerba proves to have the safety profile that it has, which is really no safety concerns compared to estrogen from a liability point of view, the physician will never even recommend estrogen therapy when compared to Menerba. So I think that we have both the patients' interest as well as the physicians' interest to really give a drug that has far less, if any, safety concerns. The main issue to remember is that estrogen risk factors were really delineated after long clinical trials. Menerba is required by the FDA and the EMA to do a one-year safety study to show really or to rule out only the uterine safety issue. And so most likely, there will still be in the minds of physician the question of what are the risks associated with breast cancer and clotting, which none of our preclinical models show any kind of risk. More so, we think that it will actually prevent breast cancer but we will not be able to prove it at the time of approval. So that will be something that may slow down the penetration initially. But once patients take it and we can collect the data post-marketing, we'll be able to probably prove that point.And then one final question before I jump back. You're really talking about a product profile that has the efficacy of low dose estrogen without the safety concerns. And I guess my question is a scientific one, how is that really possible to get all the good but none of the bad?So when estrogen was developed, there was really no clear understanding of how does it really exert its effect on the body. But it only really seems, the ‘80s that we know that there is an interaction with the protein called estrogen receptor that mediates the physiological effect of estrogen. In the mid-90s, 1996, a second estrogen receptor was discovered. And now we know that there are really 2 of those receptors, one is called alpha and one is called beta, and they really have two different functions. The alpha is really more responsible for development, proliferation and differentiation of cells. And that's why when you treat it with estrogen when it's not the appropriate time, which is menopause, there's really no estrogen left in the female body, you actually increase the risk for what it does, which is proliferation and differentiation. Unfortunately, it's in the wrong direction, the direction of cancer. The data is responsible more for the control of those kinds of effects by estrogen. So it actually has an anti-proliferative effect. And so when you target the beta, you will not get those risks associated. So the main question was, does the beta have any role in the control of thermal regulation, which is what hot flashes are? It's really an operation of the set point mechanism of temperature control in the body. Our body tends to want to be under a very, very strict temperature regulation. And what we found is that the brain area that have the set point for temperature regulation actually have a high expression of the beta receptor. And then we knew that we can have a drug that will address the hot flashes, addressing the beta receptor and will not increase the risk for cancer. So it's really by nature's design and it was just a question to find that kind of a drug that will penetrate the blood brain barrier and affect this region to really control the hot flashes. Does that...Yes, I think it would -- you said it was estrogen exerts its actions on both the estrogen receptor alpha and receptor beta.That's correct.And if alpha is responsible for the proliferative effects, so the cancer-causing effects, and Menerba does not hit alpha, it hits beta which is responsible for the thermal regulation?That's correct.Okay. Got it.[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Musket with ProMed.Just a couple of qualifying statements. So on the tolerability study, exactly how many patients are already enrolled in that?David, I don't know because it changes every day, but...Well, roughly then.About...Yes, David, I'm afraid we have not been disclosing the day-by-day progress on the enrollment. And that's just something that gets way too complicated because as Isaac said, it changes day by day. And you have the possibility of some people dropping off, drop on. So we are declining to disclose that level of detail.But we're trying to get a sense of how quickly we should expect your pivotal trial to enroll in? This would be at least a metric that we could look at, or would you suggest we -- how do you suggest we look at that?We have scheduled it such that we will be able to conclude the trial, the tolerability trial by the end of second quarter, which will give us time to start moving forward with the pivotal trial by the third quarter. And we are on track with that schedule.You're administering that in a sachet, right?Yes.And so it's twice a day?Yes.And any issues with the higher dose?So far, no.So everybody is happy with that. Did you do any other formulation changes? Change the flavor, change the way it dissolves? Is anything else that you did when you changed the formulation?Yes, we already discussed that as we changed the flavor when we removed the -- but not a significant change. It's still citrus berry flavor. And that is based on studies that women of that age prefer that type of flavor.Okay. And with the manufacturing facility, the new manufacturing facility, what level of additional yield do you think you're going to have there versus what you were getting before for the contract group?It's a four-fold per batch and twice the number of batches it can make, so it's really eight-fold.That's terrific. Just clarifying your pivotal trial, you said you wanted, obviously, a target of 15 then train an additional 20. Does that imply that 30 have already been trained and are ready to go?Yes.That's great. That's all I have.Our next question comes from Ramsey Zeneca [ph], private investor.Congratulations and kudos on the efforts on numbers to date. I only have one question and that's directed to Mr. Chester (sic) [Chesterman]. Hopefully, he can answer it, and perhaps by tomorrow, my concerns will be alleviated. With reference to the listing concerns and the deadline of September, again, with the promising numbers and encouraging numbers that you have, this may not be a concern a week or two from now. But assuming the worst, is the company considering or what ventures is the company taking to ensure continued lifting? And are you possibly considering a reverse split?Well, thanks for the question. We are not thinking any plans at this point. September is quite a ways away in terms of having lots of events and lots of activities before then to hopefully allow the stock to rise naturally above the $1 target. Certainly, reverse split is one possible solution. Another solution is to drop off the NASDAQ and move to the OTC. Another is to move to what used to be called, the American Stock Exchange. So there are a number of possibilities which we will consider if we need to at that point. I would also point out that September is not necessarily the point at which we have to make that decision. As was described in our press release and as further described on the NASDAQ website, that's the first time point. And if that is the only bid price deficiency, or the bid price is the only deficiency from a NASDAQ standpoint, we are eligible for an additional 6 months worth of consideration. So September is not necessarily the key date for when we might have to take some of those steps.Fantastic. That answers my question.Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Freeman [ph], private investor.One question, based upon your current funding and your current run rate, what is your current life expectancy for any additional funding?I'm not quite sure what you mean by life expectancy. One of the things which we are required to do in every 10-Q is to provide assurance to our investors and to our auditors and our attorneys that we have plans in place that will allow us to continue for the next 12 months. We have not yet filed the Q but it's about to be filed and in there we do indicate that it's at least the next 12 months. How long beyond that and indeed whether shorter than that, really depends on actions taken. And there are actions which you can change between now and then, so that if we were to accelerate programs, we would spend money faster. If we were to slow programs down, we would spend money slower. So it’s a very difficult question to give you a point in time which says that the life expectancy without making a lot of assumptions about what exactly we do between now and then.Okay. But based upon your current plan programs, which will I think indicated before that you're pretty much concentrating on Menerba, what do you expect? Is it 12 months you think, as far as the 10-K or 10-Q that you think it appears what [indiscernible] funding on board to justify an expectation of longevity?No, it's longer than that.Okay, so longer than 12 months.Our next question comes from the line of David McCanna [ph], private investor.Yes, really enjoying the call. Question regarding the recent publication by Life Science Advisors, which is very favorable to how both you’re proceeding and the Menerba itself, is there any comments, Dr. Cohen, regarding that favorable report that was put out in April 19?It's not favorable enough.Okay. Would you like to give us your take on how you could make it more favorable?No, I mean, of course, you know that we are strong believers in the program and that's why we carried on despite -- in line of all the difficulties that we had to face. The drug is very safe and the drug works. It's just a question of getting sufficient funding and getting through the regulatory hurdles and getting into the proper testing to prove that it actually has a place in [indiscernible] for modern medicine. So from our point of view, it's just executing the plan and delivering the necessary results to get it approved. We think we have all the sort of scientific clarity minus unforeseen things that will allow it to get it approved, and that is just, as usual, a question of time, money and effort, as well as proper communications with the regulatory agencies.Yes, I might comment as well. I mean, obviously, we think that Life Science Advisors did a very good job in trying to explain again what we do and what we're planning on doing. And that's not the only area. We've also gotten other reports, financial blogs, et cetera, has started to pick up us on the radar and begin talking about that. I just saw yet another one earlier today. So the word is beginning to get out there about what it is we have accomplished already and what we can accomplish in the future. And from our perspective, the more that we get the word out, the better because it's clear that we have something -- [indiscernible] that we have something special here and we just need to make sure that it is fully understood by the market. But the potential is as well as the risks.I appreciate that because I've been with you guys for a while now, and I guess there's a disconnect to me when I see everything and yet the stock price doesn't respond to what I see is like a tremendous opportunity. I don't know if you're allowed to comment on why you think the stock price is not reflected what I think is a fabulous, a lot of fabulous news here in the last 60 days.We're allowed to comment on it but it's as perplexing to us as it is to you. We all learn in school that the markets are efficient and then we learn through painful experience that that's not really necessarily true. But unfortunately, the only thing we can do is to continue to tell the story as well as we can and make sure that it is understood by those people making investment decisions. And believe that eventually, the markets will be efficient enough such that the shareholder value that we have created within the company is also reflected somewhat on the stock price.Yes, you guys, I just like your professionalism and my concern with the stock price, and I wonder if you can comment on this is, is that there's some short selling manipulation of it. Have you had any indication that that's going on?We certainly have had indications that there is some short selling. It's tough to believe that at this price and at this liquidity that you can make a strategy out of that. There have been -- some people have called in to us and suggested that there might be some manipulation or malevolence out there. Frankly, we're not expert enough in trading patterns to say whether that's true or not, but there are some people who believe that there is. We’ve even gotten questions from NASDAQ MarketWatch about whether or not we're aware of any, which we are not.Okay. I mean, for instance when the Life Science Advisor opinion came out, somebody sold right on that, and that was like, wait a minute, why would you sell large amounts of shares after reading that report? It's just mind-boggling. But anyway, thank you for your candor. I appreciate it.[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to you, Mr. Chesterman.Thank you very much for your time this afternoon. If we did not get to your question today, we would like to suggest that you e-mail your question to investor@bionovo.com, and we will try to respond as quickly as our other duties permit. We look forward to the next few months with great anticipation. Thank you, again, and have a nice day.Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.
Haley?It's Haley Tam from Citi. Can I ask one question on HDFC Life and a couple on flows, if I can? So firstly, with HDFC Life, can you confirm that once that sale has gone through your surplus could go to as close -- almost close to GBP 1 billion? And I just wondered if that's a sustainable level for you? What your thought processes there? And I guess, also I note that I think the maximum sale would take you to just less than 25% free flow. So interested to think about the sizing and how you thought about that. In terms of the flows, 2 questions. Firstly, the gross inflows did increase year-on-year, which is great. It does look as though that was mostly due to strategic insurance partners. So I thought could you give us an update on perhaps how much that came incrementally from Phoenix and how much of that GBP 7 billion you've identified in the past is still out there together and for Aberdeen Standard Investments? And then the final question just on Wrap and Elevate. I think the flows there did slow half-on-half, presumably due to market conditions. In terms of that going back up again, should we think about that again just being due to the market? Or should I think about the investment platform market study? And also the fee cut in elevators being relevant here?So on HDFC Life, you're right, we'll be slightly shy of the NPS. We need to get to NPS, that's kind of important in terms of if you do anything else before the NPS, it -- you have to achieve the NPS. So you don't want to leave an overhang in the marketplace.So our focus is getting in close to the NPS. Bill, in terms of capital?Yes. I mean, you're right. The sale of HDFC Life will add GBP 300-odd million to the regulatory capital surplus. So we won't -- we're not going to comment in terms of a particular target. I mean, clearly, we've said we will retain a robust surplus above the requirement.Yes, I mean let me cover the flows point and take your last question first. And Barry is here, so feel free to speak to him afterwards in more detail. And certainly, I would -- I think I'll let Campbell sort of answer the question on the flows afterwards from our strategic partners, but it did increase. And then on the Standard Life platform, certainly the first quarter is continuing to be tough because of market conditions. I think it's fair to say, Barry?And the pricing -- the repricing of Elevate I think will give us more -- we'll keep our market share and, hopefully, increase our market share. But again, feel free to go in to much more detail afterwards with Campbell and Barry.I think on the platform it's important to -- you got to remember 2017 is probably a bit of an inflated year because of DB pension transfers, which has toned down in 2018.Yes. On the Phoenix point, we were looking for 7. We got 2.5 in '18. And Campbell, I think, we're now up to 3.6. So that continues to flow through.Next, let's do the right-hand side of the room.It's David McCann from Numis. Just firstly, on the dividend guidance kind of going forward that you hold it flat during the transition. I mean, so what would it -- what would need to change for you -- for that guidance to no longer be valid? I'm thinking the downside here what would need to get kind of get materially worse for that to kind of no longer hold? Secondly, on the Retail business excluding the platforms, can you confirm that it's still unprofitable and kind of what the outlook kind of for that is? And then just following up on the HDFC point that was made there around GBP 300 million going on to surplus capital, so how much of the regulatory capital that's stated kind of already includes HDFC Life and the Phoenix business as of the 31st of December? I can remember when you stated this last time effectively most of it was excluded. Just an update there would be handy to know.Should I deal with what?Yes, you first.Last point first. Yes. I mean, it's not quite fully excluded from the regulatory capital. There's a very small percentage of each of Phoenix and HDFC joint ventures that we're able to regard as capital for regulatory purposes. So negligible, I guess.Bill, do you want to do the divi as well?Yes, divi. I mean, I think -- in answering that question, I mean, clearly it's difficult to speculate on future market conditions. I guess, what we've said is that we're prepared to maintain the dividend at the 2018 level through the transformation period in the next couple of years. By that stage, we hope and expect that market conditions and the growth of the business will demonstrate it's sustainable. But I think to answer the question in a slightly different way, you've got to think about the distributable reserves I mentioned of -- I think it about GBP 1.8 billion. And reflect -- I mean, even if the -- for every penny of lack of cover in the dividend, it's only GBP 25 million. So there's a lot of support there over and above the ongoing earnings.And Barry, the Retail one?The Retail is made up of 18.25, focus on 3.60. It's roughly breakeven. It's a very small number. It's GBP 1,000.Okay.It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of questions, please. On Slide 15, you very helpfully given us the surplus capital and the rate capital. And just to kind of further clarify, once you do the remaining buyback, once you do the stake sale and once you do the debt reduction, isn't your surplus going to drop to 0.1 rather than go up? So I just want to check that. Secondly, once you've done all the cost saves, won't the -- is the [ rate cap ] requirement I'm assuming is going to come down. If you could just tell us what that would be pro forma for the new cost base? And then just on flows, just wanted to sort of question why if you look at the gross sales and redemptions, the emerging market Aberdeen Fund has one-way performance has historically been better than, say, global or Asia Pac. But it looks like redemptions have picked up pretty significantly there. So I'm just wondering if something's changed, especially given how strong the kind of emerging backdrop has been.I'll deal with the [ rate cap ] point first. I mean, the -- I forget exactly which component you spoke about. I mean, certainly HDFC Life, the sale there will benefit the [ rate cap ]. The tender for the debt has no impact because we don't include that as -- as you'll recall, it's a Solvency II instrument, which doesn't count as regulatory capital here. The ongoing buyback, yes, we'll return to that. But to be clear, I mean, we still have the capacity to consider at some stage a further CRD IV instrument. I mean if you think it the fact that we may be 75% of the way through optimizing the balance sheet from Solvency II to CRD IV.Yes. Just on the flows. Actually, the interesting thing is the Asia Pac performance was the strongest of our equity asset classes last year, the quality funds that we have, so had very, very strong performance. So hence, we saw the outflows. I think they were only about GBP 700 million in the fourth quarter, whereas, speaking from memory, the emerging markets were about GBP 2.5 billion. But again, partly hit -- because -- and that wasn't so much performance because performance did improve for the year. It was more that trend of public to private that we're seeing. And if we see one of our sovereign wealth fund clients take money out, it'll tend -- because we tend only to manage either global for them or Asia or -- on the equity front, it would tend to come out of those mandates.Sorry, I just realized I didn't answer the other part of your question on that [ rate cap ] about the capital requirement. I agree with your analysis that logically as we get through the transformations, as we complete it, the capital requirement should come down. But we've found in the past it's always difficult to predict these sorts of things with regulator.Quite rightly, it takes every opportunity to make sure the industry is well capitalized. That sounds like a great answer, doesn't it? The regulator will like that.[indiscernible] maybe flat. DPS you're talking about account.DPS. Steady on.Good try though. Excellent question.It's Hubert Lam from Bank of America, 3 questions. Firstly, on GARS. I've seen assets under management go down to about GBP 20 billion now; heavy outflows last year. Performance on a 3- to 5-year basis is still relatively mediocre. And it seems like outflows have continued year-to-date. Just wondering where you see GARS going to. When will -- when do you expect output to stabilize? Are you seeing any more -- can you see redemption notices coming in from Institutional investors on GARS? That's the first question. The second question is on fee margin. Your fee margin fell 2 bps year-on-year. I saw that of -- from -- multi-asset also fell 4 bps year-on-year. I'm just wondering if we continue to expect the same kind of trajectory going forward in terms of fee margin compression. And the last question is on HDFC Life. So post the sale, you should have about 25% of HDFC Life still. Obviously, as you just mentioned, there are still free flow considerations. But excluding that, do you still consider that the remaining stake to be nonstrategic? And how should we think about that going forward?Let me deal with the last one first. We're in the middle of the transaction, so we can't technically comment. On GARS, we've actually seen quite a good improvement in performance. It's early days. But first, year-to-date, it's up about 2.5%. And there has been more stability, I think, in the GARS flows year-to-date and certainly in the fourth quarter. And I think you need -- the thing -- one was the cumulative impact of underperformance. And of course, one of the things we did do was Guy announced he was retiring; [ Americ ] came on board. And inevitably, I think that would have accelerated. So GARS is still in terms of our absolute returns suite a very important part of what we do. What I would reemphasize is it's GBP 20 billion of the GBP 71 billion that we manage in multi-assets. So it's -- multi-asset is a much broader sweep for us these days. Margin, Martin?It's still going to be tough, I think. Bill, what do you?Yes, I think it's still a little bit downward pressure. I mean, it's principally from the mix effect. The encouraging news we can give you is that new businesses -- the gross new business we're winning is coming in at a pretty similar mix to what we've had in the past. So we're not really seeing any reduction from that. Your point in multi-asset, of course, you're right. That's where we report the GARS flows -- the GARS assets. And that is -- we accept a higher margin than some of the other multi-assets. That's really the...But generally, the industry is tough on fees. I mean not just us. I mean I would say across the board we're seeing -- we're definitely seeing it much more competitive on fee levels than it's been in the past. So when we're doing RFPs or pitching, definitely lower than it was.Okay. Let's go along the row, and then we'll go to the back.It's Chris Turner from Berenberg. The GBP 56 million of additional or other efficiencies you've found, can we have some colors on those, please? Are they related to volume? And therefore, if your AUM should fall a bit further, we should get further cost savings? And then more kind of strategically on cost. You've got about GBP 350 million of cost or efficiency savings you've announced. But as a percent of AUM, your cost base isn't really falling that much. How do you think about that? Does that make you think you need to go back to the cost base again? Or does that mean that you think more about adding scale in other ways? And then finally, if you can just come back to the comment about the improvement. I think you said the improvement in fund performance would take time to flow-through to slower redemptions. How do you think about the other side of the equation in terms of gross sales? Will that be quicker or slower than your redemptions? Is gross sales more sensitive to performance?I think gross sales is improving for 2 reasons, investment performance, innovation. And actually, it's going to be improving from a third reason. It's going to get more of Martin's attention, which is going to be quite important going forward.I know this is -- I notice there's an article in today's press by Marty Flanagan of Invesco predicting a third of asset managers are going to lose their jobs. So I don't know whether that's true or not, but you can see how tough when one of the leading CEOs in the industry says that times are really tough. Exactly the same thing, fee pressure and costs not going down fast enough really.Bill can answer the detail question on cost. But yes, scale is part of this. We are building something here that make sure that we are improving our competitive edge. All of that innovation, our diversified positioning is about making sure that we can be a winner in the new developing environment. And on cost, Bill?Your question on the GBP 56 million. I mean, there will be a small piece of that is related to the value of assets under management that's included the third-party admin cost. But quite a lot of the GBP 56 million is really just attention to detail in terms of cutting fixed costs, which we'll obviously continue to focus on. In terms of the GBP 350 million as a percentage of AUM, I think we've got to be careful we strike the right balance. I mean, we don't want to be too focused on a particular ratio and end up cutting into the fabric of the business and make it difficult to grow.Okay. Gordon?Gordon Aitken from RBC. First question first,  Douglas, please. You've been in the chair for a short time now. In that short time, what's impressed you and where do you see the opportunity? Second question on the -- where those mandates, there's  GBP 109 billion, if you can talk about what you've done on the cost side to Life for that mandate leaving? And finally, Keith said -- you said you're one of the leading managers of insurance assets in the U.K. Insurance companies are increasingly getting into liquid assets, so social housing, ground rents, actuaries, mortgages, infrastructure. Just what you're capability in those areas?On that last point very significant in terms of a number of things that we're doing, in private credit, we've got what's effectively a factoring mandate, which is out there adding valuable basis points to insurance mandates. So we're in a lot of discussions about that panoply of...It just confirming what I've said about the sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies. They are moving from public to private. So we're seeing a lot of demand for private credit. You're quite right, student housing, all of these sort of private market are capability. So we're just -- we're looking for -- and if we're doing any bolt-ons, they would tend to be in that private market area because that's where the growth is.Yes. And with those mandates, and you can say is we're baked in, I think, effectively the GBP 350 million transformation.We can't. We can't comment on the arbitration at all. We're in the middle of an arbitration process. Douglas?Yes, thank you for the opportunity.I've [ listen ] with this of interest.Please, sit back and enjoy. Yes. I -- the first thing to say, it's been 3 months since I took the chair. It feels a lot longer because of the openness of the organization in terms of welcoming a newcomer who is keen to learn. So what's impressed me? The people, the ambition. The fact that we've got the product and geographic range that I think is very pertinent to the future, particularly our range and focus, particularly our platforms business. And all of that flowing through to the brand, which I think is extraordinarily strong. And I guess, the final thing to say is that there are things to do, a lot of things to do, but the vast majority are things we can fix. It's not as if there are things that -- there are things within the organization that are unfixable. And everyone's focused on that. So I think it's been -- I sure have enjoyed it very, very much, and it's the people and the ambition, I think, that I link to most of all along with the brand. I think it's fantastic.Andrew?It's Andrew Crean from Autonomous. 3 questions if I can. Firstly, what are the Lloyd's revenues and the Lloyd's assets under management last year? Secondly, what are your overall assets under management at the end of February? And thirdly, I notice you're not raising the GBP 350 million cost target. But within that, there was about GBP 70 million which was kind of efficiency gains, which was basically building the profitability of the platforms and the advice. That doesn't seem to have moved the needle much. I'm just wondering within your GBP 350 million whether you're actually switching a bit of that to further cost cutting?I think just on the final question first. Normally, we're still very focused on achieving that GBP 350 million plus anything more we do in way too. As I mentioned earlier, the GBP 56 million we've achieved during 2018, we're not specifying that as part of the GBP 350 million. I think it's perhaps slightly dangerous to put a new target out there because it then shifts the focus in ways that are maybe unhelpful internally.Lloyd's AUM's and revenues?Lloyd's AUM it's probably -- I'm not giving any secrets away. It's pretty much unchanged from what's reported in the December numbers. I mean, they don't tend to move dramatically month-to-month. And -- so the revenues are still pretty much as you see reported at -- of the order of -- just a little ahead of GBP 100 million.Yes. We're not disclosing.Sorry, you just answered...No, we're not -- we can't disclose this February.Gurjit Kambo, JPMorgan. Just 2 questions. Firstly, you talk a lot about private markets; and obviously, it's a great industry at the moment, lots of inflows, partners that [ rocky ], et cetera. Your flows have perhaps been a little bit weaker. What's you're positioning within private markets? Are you trying to be a big-scale player? Are you focusing on being more of a boutique player? And obviously, the duration in asset is great if you get them right. Just what are your so closed-in structures that you have? That's the first question.Yes, it's a mix of all of those. We'd like to be a scale player and a boutique player, if that makes sense because they are -- the capabilities that are being looked for are things like private markets, student housing. So we're seeing a lot of it in the -- especially the property business. And the demand is, as you say, for those sort of capabilities, student housing, logistics fund, that sort of thing, the office to residential. So a lot of thematic sort of stuff as well. But the big demand probably from our strategic partners would be definitely a private debt probably. They're looking there a lot.The funds that you're closings -- you've opened up a lot of funds last year, and you're planning for more this year. Any funds you're closing?Yes. So we looked at -- we had a program of funds consolidation, which is built into the transformation program, and we completed that consolidation program about 6 months ahead of schedule. I think there was 17 big funds. But one of the things we did together at the end of last year is we brought a lot of money market offering -- offerings together. And actually that was a big cost savings. So the planned consolidations that we knew we had to take place are pretty much -- are complete.It's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Just -- I can see there's an increasing focus on individual savings. I guess from a capabilities perspective, given some of your competitors that sort of built out other things that you potentially need to backfill to fill out that capability on the individual savings component of your business. The second question is just regards to Elevate. There's been elevated cost within that business. You had previously said that this platform would be profitable by 2019. Is that still the case? And just the final question just regards to the Solvency II debt. Why have you decided to go for a tender offer rather than just wait for the call date, which is in 3 years' time? And what is the premium of the bonds over par?Bill, why don't you do that? And then Barry will come to you and me.Yes.I mean, we've done the analysis in terms of -- you'll see -- the first call date is -- I forget which one's, but it's 2022. So it's quite a long time to go. And the net present value of taking out some of that debt note, there's a small premium, I think is still very helpful. So it's really about removing some expensive debt.The terms that we've offered this morning are to buy out at GIPS plus GBP 150 million. So I can't recall what probably -- if we were to achieve the whole amount being tendered, it's probably the premium GBP 60 million to the GBP 500 million outstanding.Barry. On the on Elevate [indiscernible] some of it could be profitable in 2018, so that we've learned on that, but we made when we [indiscernible] bottom is exactly GBP 16 million. Some of the higher costs in Elevate were as result of the depreciating cost and we expect that to follow on an ongoing basis. And in terms of the first question in gaps. We don't see that we have actually many gaps because the three platforms that we've got, in Wrap, Elevate and Parmenion, we recovered a huge portion of the market, and there is very big overlap between the users of the 3 platforms. So they are in excellent fit. And as you probably know, the Standard Life platforms, Wrap and Elevate, they're number one for adviser assets, they're number one for gross flow, they're number one for a net flow, and we think that based on the results that we've seen earlier this week that, that will continue to be the case for the full year in 2018 as well.And I suppose, Keith mentioned the fact that we have access to 30% of the Retail saver base through the strategic relationship we had for Phoenix and also a new relationship we now have with Virgin Money. So actually from a access-to-customers perspective we're in a very, very good place. Keith also mentioned some of the work that we're doing on bionic advice because all we want to do is essentially expand our reach into advice customers that we think that a majority of the assets will continue to be -- to require advice and so we're working hard obviously, empowering the high firms there, our 5 pillars, but and a bionic advice ability for the future.So I think we feel that we've done and had lot of the bases covered.Although this democratization of financial risk and the Retail consumers is becoming very popular, this is stuff we've been investing in for a very long time. So there's a lot of investment that's already gone into the business.  Probably got time for a couple more.It's Arnaud Giblat from Exane. I've got a couple of quick questions, please.Firstly, in the interims, I think you were talking about a medium-term ambition of achieving a cost-to-income ratio of 60%. This seems to have dropped. So I'm wondering if that's still the case? Or how we should think about that? I mean, clearly costs are under control, maybe revenue a little bit less so in the flow environment.And secondly, the GBP 350 million cost savings. Should we be thinking that, that will be fully achieved in 2019, and will be, therefore -- we will be looking at 2020 at a full run rate cost base? And a quick question on the platforms. I was wondering in the medium-term if you saw an opportunity to integrate all the platforms onto 1 central technology, 1 platform?I mean, obviously, the cost/income ratio is the product of 2 things, costs and income. It was almost the perfect storm last year. And we're continuing to invest to achieve scale and looking to look at how we can grow the business over the medium term. GBP 350 million, Bill?Yes, I think you're maybe setting us too much of a  challenge to achieve the full GBP 350 million in 2019. So, I mean, we're not changing our prediction. It will be fully in place by the end of 2020.It's Steven Haywood from HSBC. Just 2 questions. On your -- just to clarify. You're tendering 2 instrument. Any plans to issue a new instrument? Just a clarification on that. And then on your redemptions, you have about GBP 116 billion of redemptions in 2018. Can you say what you recapture in your gross inflows? What percentage of that are recaptured? And so should we get a net-net outflows of the business?On the Tier 2 debt, I mean, we continue to review options. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we do have the capacity to issue a bit more Tier 2 if we think the terms are right. We have no specific intention at the moment but continue to review.Yes, just on the second point. I think not as much as we would like or as we should. And mainly, that's because unlike some of the bigger players in the world we tended only to have one capability with what we would call our big strategic client. So it wasn't a natural move if they were rebalancing the portfolio and redeeming, say, an active equity portfolio for them to come to us in the past and say, "Look, can you manage this property portfolio or this private credit portfolio?" And that's part of how we're reshaping the business and really trying to get out there that we can manage those capabilities for our big clients. Obviously, with the, shall we say, taking Phoenix as an example, yes, we would tend to recapture a lot there but not enough in some of our other big strategic clients. And hence, you'll see the flows. When I alluded to earlier, they're going to the Partners Groups, the Blackstones, those sort of businesses. So it's -- but we're the same as most of the other big active fund managers in that respect. We're no worse than others. We're just not as good as we'd like to be.Good. I think that's -- you want to sum up, Martin?Yes, can I just say thank you again and pay tribute to my CFO here, 34 years. When he started, the turnover was GBP 100,000, and we made GBP 109  profit. So -- and you have regularly voted him #1 buy side -- sell side. Sorry, I got that wrong. And he also wins buy side. I used to only win sell side. The buy side never trusted me as much as Bill. So Bill, thank you.Yes, it's been a pleasure.You can now ask him.I would just like to say his hair was black when he first employed me.Thank you, guys. Thank you.Okay. Thank you very much.
I think some of the investors are asking about our 2021 outlook. I just put it on the last part, and the first part will be on our third quarter performance first. Okay, so let's start with the first question from Mr. Jemmy Huang of JPMorgan. Jemmy wants to know for the TWD 2.1 billion decline on investment income in third quarter, how much is related to swap revenue if any?Actually, for the whole year, from our treasury gains, the swap gains was one of the parts that fall behind and a very huge part. Up to the third quarter of this year, the swap gains actually diminished nearly TWD 2.4 billion. And this was part of the reason that the narrowing spread between U.S. and NT dollars, actually, I mean contribute -- attributed to the big loss and fall behind our projection. And another projection for next year will be the swap gains will further drop another TWD 2.2 billion after we decreased nearly TWD 2.4 billion swap gains this year.So we will see that the swap transaction will become more normalized, that the extra or the excess liquidity will go back to the interbank lending instead of the swap trading. And you can see that actually our net interest income gradually moved upward to become a positive growth. So in that sense, the -- I mean in the past 2 years, the once very juicy swap gains would no longer exist as long as the U.S. rates remain low. So for -- I mean the swaps opportunities should not exist anymore. So I'll highlight the figures for the whole year for swap, we project for this year is TWD 2.4 billion, and next year will be another TWD 2.2 billion diminution of swap gains.Okay. Thank you, Annie. And I hope her answer has answered your question, Jemmy.  Okay, the next question is about our NIM performance. There's a question from [ Ken ] and from [ Gina Chen ] of President Securities. They hope to know what is the reason behind the performance that why NIM stabilized despite the lower LDR ratio and spread in third quarter, which means that we see that the spread of third quarter is declining, but the NIM remained flattish. I think...Yes, I know what you -- yes, okay. The thing is that we witnessed the falling spread due to competition in the market. So actually, we strategically, I mean, hiked our loan yield over our lending. It implies that we become more picky to select customers, actually price higher loans yield on our lending starting from the mid of this year. It implies that once very attractive -- the FX spread no longer supports our NIM like it did before. So we managed to hike our NT dollars loan yield in order to bottom out the impact of the NIM. So in that sense, even though the LDR moved lower but our spread managed to move upward, this is something that we try to do.  And after the subsidized lending cut -- lending yield cut for the mortgage and other retail lending ends in the third quarter this year, it also helped to stabilize our NIM. So these 2 major factors can attribute to the stabilized NIM. But I must say that going forward, due to the still very fierce competition in the market, so our projection for NIM will not be very aggressive anyway. Yes.Okay. Thank you, Annie. And we have another question. It's about our October spread and how it may look like after the third quarter. We have strategically policy waiver for the retail...Well, fortunately, our most updated spread turned more stabilized, and the NIM seems also stabilized around 0.99%. But the thing is that because the demand for FX loan remain subdued, so the NT dollar spread still remain quite -- or still under pressure. So for our projection of next year's NIM, we're still under -- I mean below this year's level. Actually, our projection for next year NIM will be slightly lower than the level that we have this year, maybe another 2 to 3 bps lower, yes, because the loan demand from FX lending still remains sluggish anyway.But the October spread, I remember that the NT dollar spread actually went up for 3 bps for the...Yes, 2 to 3 bps.Yes, 2 to 3 bps comparing with September spread.Yes. Yes, stabilized here.Okay. Thank you. I hope the answer --this answered your question.  Okay. Let's go to next question from Jemmy Huang. And Jemmy hopes to know what the NIM in fourth quarter that we have observed so far. And what's the recurring trend that we expect to see in the first half of 2021 NIM?For our NIM projection going into the final quarter this year, it still remain, I mean, remain low. A similar level with what we have seen in the third quarter, still around 99 bps or somewhere just around this level. But for next, I mean, for next year, at least for the first half of next year, we will still see no aggressive NIM expansion. We're still expecting a weak NIM contraction or marginal contraction around 2 to 3 bps. So it implies that it may be another 2 to 3 bps lower for the first half of next year.Okay. And also there's another question. It's about the spread decline by another 3 bps in the third quarter, but why is our NIM is maintaining stabilized?  And I think I can answer this question. It's because in our slide, our spread actually shows the quarterly result, but our NIM is full year results. So that's why the NIM actually needs to be divided by the full year from the first quarter to the third quarter. So that shows a stabilized NIM. But however, our spread actually is calculated by quarterly. So when it shows the another 3 bps, it reflects the policy rate cut for the retail borrowers in the third quarter, especially in the third quarter. Okay. I hope that answers the question from guest. And let's move to the next question. What's the updated guidance on wealth management fee growth for the full year of 2020, Annie?For the fee revenue this year, it was not that promising due to the sales of the bancassurance business did not perform that well. The only bright side would be the sales of mutual funds. But unfortunately, bancassurance dominates half of the revenue for the wealth management. Therefore, after we've seen the nearly 40% bancassurance fee drop, the overall wealth management fee actually dropped nearly 8.5%. So in that sense, we would see -- next year, we are targeting a more aggressive fee revenue growth, up to 10% to 11%, because the base period seems relatively low for us. And for the fee revenue, the major drawback that we encounter will be, apart from the change of the regulation and also because of the very volatile capital market in -- that disturbed our consultant -- financial consultant to approach our clients to deliver decent products that help them gain something from their investments. But looking forward into next years, we would see that the demand for the investment products is still there. The bank rates will remain low. So we would target a more aggressive fee revenue growth, particularly from the wealth management. Actually, our projection for the fee revenue next year hopefully will be 10% to 11% for the wealth management. And for the non-wealth management, particularly for loan, it will continue to maintain a strong stance to grow up to 13%, 1-3 percent. So it implies that this year, our fee revenue will be a negative performance. But next year, we would target double-digit growth for wealth management, 10% to 11%. And non-wealth, particularly for loan-related, the target will be 13%.Okay. Thank you. And let's move to the second part. I think every investor is concerning about our 2021 guidance. So let's move to the guidance of our 2021 for our business in terms of our business part. Okay. So let's start from our loan growth projection. Okay, can Annie give us some picture about our loan growth structure for 2021?If we look at this year's growth pattern, it pretty much mirror the structure of different markets, I mean, home and abroad. In the past, overseas market took a lion's share to grow up to, let's say, 11%, 20% or even higher growth rate. But this year, the once very booming overseas market actually see a negative growth. However, the 2 major pillars: one is our niche market, the SME growth -- SME lending. We managed to grew up to 11 -- more than 11% to 12%, which is pretty much subject to, one, is the relocation of the supply chain. And another thing is that the domestic investments. And of course, some of the bailout plan will be included.And the other pillar came from now very attractive property investment, which will translate to the mortgage lending. Our mortgage book advanced by 6% this year. And this is purely very organic style because a lot of investors, they poured their money into risk investment to gain higher return than the other financial investments. So these 2 markets will continue to boom next year. So for our projection for the total loan book structure, we will continue to expand our lending in the SME markets and the mortgage book as well. For next year, our total lending would continue to expand by another, let's say, 6% to 7%. We will see that would not be a problem because up to the end of October this year, our loan book will be -- booked a growth rate up to nearly 9%. In terms of the GDP projection next year, around 4% in Taiwan, we would see this 6% to 7% should be quite achievable. And given the overseas market remains not very stable after the pandemic spread across the whole region, we still managed to grow our overseas lending, particularly in the ASEAN countries. So we set up a goal that we would grow our FX lending by around 6% to 7% after it recorded a very weak negative 5% growth this year. So next year, overseas market, particularly for FX lending, we will still manage to grow by 6% to 7%. So for total lending, total loan book, we would target 6% to 7% growth. SME market continued to boom. We managed to book another 7% to 8% growth. FX loan, we would grow by 6% to 7%. And the mortgage book will be one sector that we will be more cautious due to that our ceiling for the...Bank Act.The Bank Act, the 72.2 that we would have to prepare sufficient deposits before we can further expand our mortgage. So next year, our mortgage lending would contract a bit from 6% this year to be lower to 6 -- 4% to 5%. So for loan book, next year is still quite a bright projection.Okay. Let me summarize the loan book for everyone in case that you ask again. For the total loan book, we project 6% to 7% for next year. And in terms of the sectors, in SME, we project 7% to 8%. And as for FX lending, we project a 6% to 7% growth. And for mortgage, that's more moderate, that we project a 4% to 5% growth for the next year. Okay. Let's move to the next part of our fee revenue. And given a pretty low rate period for this year, how does Annie project for the next year's fee revenue performance?I think I just mentioned a bit, okay, fee revenue next year.Oh, okay. In terms of the fee revenue, Annie just projected 11% to 12% for the total fee revenue growth. And how about the wealth management and the non-wealth management part?We target fee revenue growth over wealth management up to 10% to 11%. 10% to 11% wealth management.10% to 11% for the wealth management part. And for non-wealth?Non-wealth, 13%.13%, 1-3, okay, 13%. A pretty low base and also a declining base period for this year. Let's move to the third part, it's our treasury gains. And how would, first, take a look the treasury gains for next year, given a pretty low base, low rate environment continuing, that the Fed will continue the low -- actual low environment until 2025?Well, it's not very promising because the shrinking swap gains that I just mentioned will persist. So I just highlight that the swap gains for next year will continue to shrink by TWD 2.2 billion after we had lost TWD 2.4 billion swap gain this year. And apart from that, our investment in the U.S. dollars fixed income portfolio would also shrink a bit. Even though our trading gains was up nearly 16%, but the yield, the loss on the yield will continue. So in that sense, next year's treasury projection would continue to form another 20% decrease for treasury...Okay. So the swaps are booming...No, no.Okay. Go back to the core business, then...Yes, the lending and the fee revenue.Lending and fee revenue will be the major 2 drivers for next year's performance. And the treasury will just gradually strength because of the actual low rate period and the capital market. And the swap revenue will continue to shrink.Yes.Okay. Let's move to the expense side. How is the credit cost will look like next year?We actually suffer a bit for the surge in credit cost this year, particularly from overseas markets, that we talked about our 2 major profit source: one is the U.S. and the other is London, 2 cities hit hard by this pandemic impact. So in that sense, we would see that -- sorry, K. C., would you repeat the question again?Okay. So let's move to the credit cost side next year. How does First Bank...So this year, our strategy lies on that any NPL surface in the overseas market, we would immediately charge off the losses from the overseas market, especially for the 2 major financial hubs. And fortunately, for domestic NPL, apart from the legacy of Powertech and another legacy SME portfolio, we did not witness any surface of the NPL influx. So in that sense that going into next year, we would see a falling credit cost, net credit cost to below 20 bps from the high of this year's around 24 bps to just 17, 1-7 bps.1-7 bps for the total credit cost.1-7 bps next year. Yes.That's net, right? We're talking about net?Yes. Net, yes. Yes, yes. After we posted a relative high net credit cost, around 24 bps this year, mainly driven by the overseas and the legacy Powertech.Okay. And we have a follow-up question from Gina Chen. She hopes to know that, how is your Powertech situation after we have set aside a provision for it? And is there any actual provision for Powertech or for the domestic steel factories or for the overseas health care? Or are you talking -- oh, we're talking about the NMC. Is there any actual provisioning for these 2 big cases?For Powertech exposure, we have set aside around TWD 1 billion against the total exposure TWD 1.5 billion. Because the Powertech steel, we still own some collateral. It takes time to dispose the collateral before we can recover. So out of this TWD 1.5 billion, we have set aside TWD 1 billion. So the -- actually, provision ratio is up to nearly 70% -- no, 66%. So nearly resolved most of the legacy. And in terms of the NMC, the total exposure is up to 30 billion, yes -- sorry, USD 30 million. USD 30 million, we have charged off all of this exposure. We have set aside 100% of this exposure.So all of the cases are ending up or set in the third quarter, right? Right, in the third quarter?Yes, yes, yes.Okay. So we have ended up with provisioning for NMC and Powertech in the third quarter. And there is no actual provision...No, no need.Yes, to be provide -- to be set aside on the next following quarters for these cases.Yes. I'll also add up one thing that I understand that some investors is concerned about the bailout program that we actually engaged quite a bit. But we must explain a bit to this -- the risk associated with all this bailout program will be up to 80% to 100% guaranteed by government credit insurance fund. So in that sense, the charge-off or any NPL influx will not be a huge impact to us.Okay. And let's move to the last part of our SG&A and the CI ratio part. And how is the outlook of our CI ratio for the next year?After we recorded nearly 46% CI ratio, we would manage to -- I mean maintain -- try to maintain the level that we used to be. But for next year, due to the still relatively low interest rate spread and the just-recovered fee revenue and the still weak treasury gains, the revenue source -- I mean the total net revenue growth would not be that strong like it did in the past. So in that sense that we would see that the CI ratio would move up a bit. So our target for next year's CI ratio will be content below 48%, low -- I mean higher, about 2% higher than this year's level.48% for the CI ratio.For next year's projection, yes, from 46% to 48%.All right, from 46% to 48%. Okay. Let's move -- we have Annie up with our projection for the next year.So let's move to the next question, which is about the LTV method adoption that 3 investors are asking, from Jemmy Huang and a guest and Michael. And they hope to know, after the new revised LTV-based risk weight method adoption, how would it impact our lower mortgage risk weight asset? How would it impact our CAR ratio, CET1 ratio and Tier 1 ratio in the coming 2021?Okay. After we made some simulation against the revised LTV method, our risk-weighted assets, we had a conclusion that for our total CAR would have extra 93 bps, 9-3 bps. And in terms of Tier 1, it will be an extra 87 bps. And for the CET1, it would be 83 bps. So all up to 83 bps something.Okay. I hope that -- so let me repeat again. For the CAR ratio, it will be a lift of around 9-3, 93 bps. For the CET1, it's -- for the CAR and for the Tier 1, it's about 87 bps. And for the CET1, around 83 bps or about 80 bps. Okay. I hope these 2 figures that have answered your question. But let me state again, it's just a simulation results based on our second quarter 2020. So we will adopt the all-new LTV method from 2021 after the second quarter. So basically, it will recalculate your gains. So it will be...Yes. Overall -- I mean roll over another plan. Yes.Okay. There is another question, and it's about our strategy of our next year. How would your group continue -- or especially the bank, how would it -- how will you look at your depository and your lending strategy? And what it will be look like? And how would you take on the duration of the SME lending as your most important part of your loan book?Given that we act as a niche player in the domestic loan market, our core business is focused on our relation with SME and also our retail clients from mortgage and the -- and also these corporate clients when they operate in the overseas market. So we would manage to expand our loan book, I mean, via a more, what we will say, value-added service to them to help them expand or relocate their business in Taiwan that help them capture the opportunities in this trade war between 2 big countries. We have seen a strong demand that a lot of this manufacturer, they try to expand their expansion in Taiwan or in ASEAN countries post the trade tension. So we would see that our lending activities will continue to boom, particularly for the SME sectors as the most of the large corps or some blue-chips company can easily tap the capital market by issuance, relatively cost-effective bond issuance. So we were quite optimistic that we can help to serve these SME sectors via our franchise to help them. And in terms of our business with mortgage or other secured personal lending, it will be a new start that we detected new -- I mean fresh demand by this year's retail bailout plans that some new customers actually approach us to apply for this bailout package, and we would detect the demand that they would need some secured lending. It will also help us to explore the new opportunities via this very fresh bailout customer base for us. So for next year, our main focus will be, apart from our SME book and also the retail customers from this newly acquired database, will be another target that will help us to further penetrate into their secure lending or bundled with mortgage lending. So we would see for next year our focal point still placed in domestic market and along with some recovery in the overseas lending that we will manage to grow moderate growth, around 6% to 7% in the FX lending. So this will be our strategy for next year loan book expansion. And in terms of the NIM strategy, we would see for the first half of next year, there's no big chance that we can hike our loan yield due to we're still in the mood to attract new customers and also competition from the peers. So the NIM projection would see more moderate or even slightly lower than this year's level. So this will be our major market strategy for next year. And I also would like to highlight that based on these new customers that we acquired from the bailout plan that we can also help them to manage their wealth. We understand that for this year, actually, a lot of young generation, they would like to start their investment into the stock market. So this is somewhere that we can also penetrate to help them open their equity or stock market account and help them manage their not very huge portfolio and to deliver good products for these new customers to expand our wealth management and new customer sectors. So all of this will be our major strategy for next year.Okay. Can Annie talk about the new customer base? You are talking about the new bailout labor project.Yes.How many cases that First Bank has been stand out for the new customer base? Just give us some picture, some color of...Okay. Well, okay, last year, for the individual, I mean for the retail bailout program, we acquired around nearly 100 -- 100 -- around 110,000.110,000.110,000 yes. Around 11,000, 11 -- sorry, around 111 -- not 11, 110,000, 110,000 new accounts.110,000.But we actually approved just 80 -- around 80,000. So it implies that these customers will...Continue to grow...Yes, will become our new -- yes, yes, our new customers.Because this part is not usually what we have had.Yes. Yes, not in our customer profile.Profile, of course. So you said that this customer base can bring out more on secure loan opportunity percent.Yes.And we have another follow-up question. It's about our bank at 72.2, the mix. And can Annie tell us how -- what the First Bank's 72.2 figures until the third quarter or until the end of October?The most updated figure was end of October, we have reached 28.1%.28.1% something.Yes. End of...End of September.September, October, yes. So we're pretty much close to the ceiling.Okay, pretty much. Okay.So you can see that our deposit growth is very strong.So how much can First Bank do basically on the 72.2?30% is billing. 30%.Okay. 30% is the billing...But we are now up to...Around 66 -- TWD 46 billion.Yes, yes, yes.Okay. Another question from Gina Chen, hopes to confirm that -- Annie just talked about the mortgage -- the total loan book has already grew by 9% until October. So can Annie give us some update for the total loan book growth for the full year of 2020.I suppose that will be similar to the third quarter. Listen up, because up to October, it's quite similar to September.9%.Yes, 9%. Yes, Mortgage...The total loan book.Yes. I mean, yes, up to October, the total loan book expanded by 9%. And among which the SME, yes, nearly 11%; and mortgage, 5.9%. The overseas market is still contracted. So mainly...Do you think that the 9% growth will be sustained until the end of December?Yes. Yes, it should be. Yes, yes, yes.All right.Yes. So after we posted a strong loan growth, next year, we will continue to grow by another 6% to 7%. Yes, that's for sure.Okay. And another follow-up question from Jemmy Huang from JPMorgan is that after we adopt the new LTV, revised LTV method from next year, will First Group consider to increase your cash payout ratio?That's a good question, Jemmy. But we were looking into our dividend policy as a whole, not just for one factor, because actually, this year, our bottom line, actually, for nearly 16%. So we would see how much we can deliver to the investors. After all the factors being considered, we will still manage to deliver up to 60% to 70% dividend payout. That's our policy.Okay. I think I hope Annie's question can answer -- Annie answered your question. Okay. Annie, here is another question. It's about our lending rate at the end of this year, from [ Michael Lam ] of [ Calpay ]. And Michael hopes to know, after the end of 25 bps actual mortgage rate cut for these credit line for these borrowers, what will it look like for the overall lending rate? By how many bps will -- after the end of the payout program?I cannot project the actual lending yield, but the impact revenue from the subsidized mortgage lending figure was around TWD 300 million, right?Right. Total revenue...Around TWD 300 million. The total figure was around TWD 300 million.Yes, TWD 300 million.Yes. So I suppose the translation from these figures into the spread should be minimal. Yes, not much. This TWD 300 million is quite minimal.Okay. And we have the last question. And the last question is about our bank insurance subsidiary. After we have seen that life insurance subsidiary has turned positive starting from last year, and how would First Group take a look this life insurance subsidiary? Is there any recap plan for it for the coming years?Yes, we would manage to grow our life insurance unit as our second profit driver among -- apart from the bank units. We will need to recap the company, but not very huge. The extra capital injection should be less than TWD 1 billion. So it's quite affordable for us. So we would manage to expand its asset under management, first to stand up to TWD 50 billion and further grow beyond. But the recap plan will be in the pipeline next year or going forward. But nothing much would be required for the IFRS 17 implementation, mainly for the expansion plan.Okay. Thank you, Annie, and thank you for everyone who participated in today's website -- web conference. And this is the last web conference that we have held for this year. And we'll see you next year, 2021. Bye-bye. Have a good day.K. C., I'll interrupt one thing. I have seen that Jemmy raised question about our NPL ratio for overseas, right?Oh, right.Jemmy, last answer for you. The NPL ratio of our overseas branches dropped to 0.13% after we charged most of the exposure and losses. So it was down from 0.35% to 0.13%, just 1/3 of the level. So not to worry, we have charged most of these losses, okay?Okay. Thank you, Annie.Okay. Thank you.Those are all of the questions today. See you in 2021. Bye.Bye-bye.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Klas Bergelind from Citi.It's Klas from Citi. First, on the order pipeline. Obviously, this strong growth has taken place before and you proffer upgrade cycle to back with driven machines. And we know of miners out there that intend to replace its entire fleet underground to battery-driven equipment. So what did you see in the quarter? And this is the first time your battery range is commercial. And looking further out, your green ambition with 50% of revenues by 2030 from carbon-free equipment. Can you talk a little about the likely mix here between battery-driven equipment and other ways to reduce carbon?Yes. So the order pipeline, I think what we saw in Q1 was very much the same as we have seen in previous quarters with small numbers of -- 1 or 2 machines being ordered when it comes to electrical machines. But there are, as you say, some very interesting projects out there with mines that would like to go for full electrical fleet. And of course, we are working together with those customers on that. I would like to highlight the acquisition of Meglab that we did now during Q1, which of course will give us capabilities also to support our customers on this journey and take the responsibility also to make sure that the electric infrastructure, we can be able to cope with battery technology. So that together with the retrofit initiative that we have ongoing, we have the first model ready now, and we will continue, of course, to expand this offering in the coming quarters. Then we have a solid offering for electrification in the coming years.Just a quick follow-up, if I may. On Surface drilling, where you have a very strong position, some of your peers, guess who, now have an ambition out there to take market share on the surface side. Can you talk about what you're doing in drilling, whether you also see battery and automation potential, maybe not to the same extent as underground or whether we see any inflection? What products you have in the pipeline? You obviously took a large order with [ Re ] on the surface side, strengthening your position, but interested in your thoughts on the surface side?On the surface side, we have a very strong position. And if you look on the technologies there that are embedded in many of the larger orders that we have landed also during this quarter, they are related to fully autonomous machines. What we have in the pipeline is mixed fleet automation to be able to run the Pit Vipers and the D65 machines on one platform, for example. And then, of course mixed feet automation also when it comes to trucks. So it's a lot of initiatives ongoing towards the most advanced autonomous solutions that are available in the surface space. Then on batteries, as we said, our goal at 2030 is to provide the full range also with, let's say, emission-free products also for surface, and that is what we're working towards now.Our next question comes from the line of Arsalan Obaidullah from Deutsche Bank.Obviously a very strong quarter in terms of orders, especially on the new equipment side. But obviously given a peer that reported last week had sort of also very strong numbers and some ways stronger just confirm that is this sort of just a more sort of timing issue with certain large orders to come through? Or are there sort of other challenges that you're seeing, given that obviously there's a very strong backdrop for yourselves in terms of this favorable commodity environment?I think generally speaking, we see -- we saw both in Q3 and Q4 that there was an underlying good activities. Many customers took decision to invest in equipment. We continue to see that also in Q1. But on top of that, also that more customers also took decision to go for larger package. So I would say it's very much the same underlying activities that we have seen in the last -- in 3 quarters now. And then, of course, a number of larger ones as well on top of it.And you're not sort of seeing sort of, let's say, market share, that's not a concern of yours at this stage, and sort of anything like that, you're quite sort of comfortable on that side of things?Certainly.I think the answer was no on that question.Yes, yes. No, we are not concerned when it comes to our market shares. Sorry, if that was the question.I think that was the question.We're not -- yes, we are not concerned.Okay.Yes. Sorry.The next question comes from the line of Max Yates from Credit Suisse.Just my first question would be around what exactly is driving the pickup in equipment orders. I mean could you give us a feel of whether this is some pent-up demand from last year as kind of people come back to the mine site, some of the decision-makers kind of do some overdue replacements? Or are you actually seeing kind of a lot more kind of expansion plans coming through, even some sort of greenfield mining plans from the junior miners? Just a little bit of feel kind of what has driven that sort of SEK 1 billion step-up in equipment.So we see good activities in iron, copper and gold. And when we look at the type of orders, it's both expansion, expansion of existing fleet, and replacement. And on top of that, of course we also see good demand for midlife upgrades or rebuilds, which is also a signal that customers are really trying to push the output as much as possible now.Okay. And just my follow-up question would be on the 4,900 connected machines that you mentioned with telematics. So I'm just curious to understand, is this a sort of, an offering which sort of comes with the equipment or when we talk about these kind of 4,900 connected machines, are we talking about sort of an annual charge for using the software, using the service. Is this a sort of separate charge for the customer? Or is this just something that comes, sort of keeps you ahead of the competition? And is this sort of offering within your existing service business? I think I explained that badly, but I think you understand the question. Do you take an annual sort of service charge for this?Yes. Yes. So the solution by itself comes with equipment. Then customers need to pay for the level of intelligence that we provide them with given the data that we collect from all these machines.The next question comes from the line of Maddy Singh from Bank of America.Just couple of questions from my side. Firstly, on the equipment order side, very strong growth. I'm just wondering how much of that is coming from greenfield spend, if at all, what trends are you seeing on that side? Is there a willingness to spend there? And secondly, return on capital now around 21%. Does that level concern you at all? Or is there a plan to bring it up in short to medium time? Or we have to wait for some meaningful M&A transaction to see this picking up?So if I start with the first one, and then maybe you can comment on the return there. So the equipment growth that we have seen in the last, I would say, 3 quarters, it is replacement and brownfield, not that many greenfields. However, there are of course greenfields in the pipeline, but that is more on a, say, evaluation level. So not yet translated into orders.Can you repeat the second question? I'm not sure I got the full.So just wondering, your return on capital, just about 21% now. So historically you have had very high return on capital, so does 21% level concern to you?Yes, yes, yes. So…Is there a plan to bring it up? Or do we need to wait…No, no, no. Now I understand. Sorry, I didn't catch, you broke up a little bit. I mean the -- you could say that when you measure the return on capital employed, we measure it during a 12-month period, so -- and the difference between last year and this year more or less split 50-50 in the accumulation of capital employed, which you can translate into cash. And the other is actually that over the last 12 months, given the Q2 as the first of 4 quarters in the 12-month period was lower. So the second half of the reduction in the return on capital employed is actually a lower profit level over the last 12 months.And we always have plans ongoing when it comes to inorganic growth as well. So hopefully we will come back on that as well.And then, maybe to repeat a little bit. I mean the cash buildup, which I explained to you, I'm sure you have seen that also, that obviously a big chunk of that will be distributed in Q2, and a smaller piece then as the second installment of the dividend in November.The next question comes from the line of Nick Housden from RBC Capital Markets.I just have a couple. So looking at the 55% organic growth in equipment orders, can you give us a sense of maybe what this would have been without the large orders, to maybe get a sense of the underlying small and medium order demand? And then as just a follow-up to that question. We have had a few quarters where customers have been holding off on the large orders and now these do seem to be coming through, which is obviously a good thing. Do you think we've turned a corner maybe now with the vaccine rollout going well in many parts of the world and that we can maybe expect for stronger -- or should I say, a large, a number of large orders coming through in the next few quarters?I think that, if I start with the second one, that it's always very difficult to predict when the large orders will come. As I said, the pipeline has very much been the same for quite some time. It's just the decision is being pushed out in time since the planning horizon for many mining companies are very long. But of course, given the strong commodity prices, expansions are part of the long-term planning also for -- and short-term planning for many mines, trying to increase capacity as much as possible. If we look on the large orders in the quarter, I don't maybe have the numbers, but let's maybe roughly, could we say SEK 500 million comes from the large orders, roughly? Something like that.Yes, it's a little bit less, I would say, if we define the large orders as the ones who are above are above SEK 100 million.SEK 400 million, maybe EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million. As I said, we had many orders just below the threshold of SEK 100 million that we defined as a large order.Our next question comes from the line of Guillermo Peigneux from UBS.I wanted to ask about lead times of order intake. Can you comment a little bit on how the time is actually moving for, let's say, fourth quarter orders into first quarter are and what you're taking now?Yes. So lead time varies a lot between the different machine types that we have. The smallest machines and the simpler machines that we could have 3- to 4-month lead time. And of course, the more complex the machines become, if we take the largest Pit Vipers, for example, for surface machines, there we're up to 9 month lead times. And that's normal lead times and acceptable lead time from the market as well.I mean that is being impacted by recent supply chain issues? Or are you able to deliver as fast as you were able to deliver maybe fourth quarter?Yes. And I would say that it's not really -- of course, there are some disturbances on the inbound as well as on the outbound. I think that goes -- it's the same for more or less all companies right now. But I would say that it's more the normal lead time. We manufacture our equipment in Sweden, in U.S. and China and India, and then you ship it also by sea to the different regions and different countries. So it is normal lead times. I don't see that lead times are starting to be prolonged right now. Then of course there -- of course, there are still challenges when it comes to the supply chain in general. But I think that is -- we have managed also to find ways to continue to do business given the circumstances. We have been in this situation now for almost a year.Our next question comes from the line of Christian Hinderaker from Liberum.Just interested to understand what you're looking at in terms of M&A pipeline. Obviously there's 2 transactions during the quarter. And clearly, a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Just interested in any further plans there And sort of what sort of activity levels you are seeing.So the M&A agenda for us is very much linked to building a strong technology platform around the technology shifts that are shaping the industries that we serve. I think the Meglab acquisition is one good example where we take on a company that will enable a faster rollout of our technologies. Then we are also focusing on growing our customer share in the aftermarket. And the DandA acquisition in the quarter is a good example of that one. Then on top of that, of course, if you look on what we did in Q4 with the MineRP acquisition, I think that is also moving into then the digital space in a different way, offering software products and software solutions that will help the mines to optimize the drill to mill. So this is a space where we are actively looking for targets.I mean I think it's fair to say for the record that obviously you see a part, but we are very active.The next question comes from the line of Robert Davies from Morgan Stanley.My first one was just around the aftermarket activity. You mentioned the midlife refurbs. I know there was a tougher comp on the service business in the quarter. But just -- so more broadly, I know you still called out midlife refurb. How much runway do you think you've got ahead of you in terms of that mid-life refurb activity? It's obviously been a bit of a kicker over the last year. But just wondered how far down the road you've done in terms of, and sort of targets you're looking at?I think there is still more to do there. And as always, in an uptick in the market where production volumes are going up, then -- and also many customers don't want to wait for a new machine. And then the midlife rebuild is a faster way to get productivity up. When we look at -- we don't have a full offering of midlife rebuilds for all our machines yet. We have started of course with the fleet where we have the biggest opportunity, and that is what we have been working with so far. So I continue to see good opportunities when it comes to midlife rebuilds to support of course the rest of the customer share development that we're also working with. And as I said, we had quite tough comparisons compared to last year. But if I look on the overall activities in the aftermarket, you can see that also in the nice growth. We have 40% up for Tools & Attachments. That of course gives a good understanding also of the actual drilled meters out there. So the activities in the aftermarket or the actual production out there is high. And I would say that in all regions, it's back to the levels we saw before the pandemic.And then my follow-up was just around the progression on sales. I heard relatively solid order growth on the -- sort of through the back half of last year. And just looking at today's numbers when we were coming in, I think orders are running a bit ahead of consensus and sales were a bit below. Just wondered if you had any issues on the sales side in terms of delivering those products from Cytec's customers receiving and signing off any of the products. Is that even an important aspect to sort of booking and recording the sales in your business? That was my follow-up.No, it's more related to the lead, lead item actually for us to translate the orders into actual revenue. So it's not -- of course, a lot of the -- what we have as revenue this quarter is what we -- the orders we gained in the middle of the pandemic. So it's more the lead time of -- normal lead times of equipment. Then of course we also had a very strong Q4. So it's always that lag when it comes to the equipment. When it comes to the aftermarket, it's turning much, much faster.The next question comes from the line of William Mackie from Kepler Cheuvreux.My first question really would come back again to the execution of the order backlog. You flagged that there's this between 3- and 9-month delay from the very strong order intake that we've seen. When you're looking at the production systems, to what extent are you -- do you have to, at this point, increase investments, personnel, additional expansionary capacity, to meet the planned expansion over the next 12 to perhaps 18 months? So the first question is, what's your thinking on expansion and investments and additional costs to deliver on the growing backlog?So we have our asset-light manufacturing strategy, which is, in essence is that we do the final assemble ourself and then we have subsuppliers that do part of the assembly. And this philosophy has served us well over the years, both in upticks and when the market goes down. And the way we are doing it is that we always -- we work with temporary workers, and we have done that for many, many years as well. So what we are doing right now, of course and we have been doing that for quite some quarters now, is to add temporary resources in our manufacturing assembly lines for equipment. So that is normal -- the normal way of handling the swings.Okay. The follow-up really relates again to the telematics question. You called out 4,900 connected machines. How do you see -- how should we think about that number in terms of, in relation to the potential for increasing the penetration of your installed base with increased telematic or connected capabilities to support the productivity of your customers? So are you continuing to roll out? How much of the installed base opportunity is now captured?So I would say that we have captured a fair portion. And it is to the level where you can -- you get good statistics from 4,900 machines. This is an enabler to grow the aftermarket, especially in the segments where we have small customers with fewer machines that is not being used maybe 24/7, especially for the infrastructure segment. So I really see that this enables, of course, data insights where the machines are, how much they're consuming, et cetera. And their health situation gives us the understanding of also what type of service products we can develop to capture a bigger share of aftermarket. So I see it very much as an enabler. Of course, the data as such is important for the customers from a productivity standpoint. And that work we're doing together with our customers, with dashboards, et cetera, to support their productivity. But it's also extremely valuable insights for us to work with growing our customer share in the aftermarket.A maybe to add to this, obviously we -- the cost of putting one of these solutions on a new machine is fairly small these days compared to if you go back a few years, the cost of the hardware, the cost of equipping a new machine is really small. So it's just really the low-end machines that are not equipped from factory. So it's just a matter of if the customer would like to use the service or not, and then we can actually just switch it on. We also have something called HATCON on our hydraulic attachments, which is something we introduced not very long ago. And that actually gives an opportunity also to the attachment business.The next question comes from the line of Olof Larshammar from DNB Markets.And it's a bit one on the aftermarket and especially sales, I can say that aftermarket revenues is down a bit in Q1 compared to Q4, while order intake is on a similar level. And from what I can recall historically, it sounds like your aftermarket is normally stable or growing slightly in Q1 sequentially versus Q4. So I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on that.No. But I mean -- no, not really. But I think it's, this year, this last year has been different, if I say so, with closures and openings and the pandemic. But it's -- so I can't really comment on the sequential comparison. We know that, in general, the beginning of a new year tend to be slow. We have a lot of business in the Southern Hemisphere with South America, Southern Africa and Australia. So that sometimes have an impact on the activity level.And maybe one thing to mention, when it comes to the midlife rebuilds, there is of course a lead time also to do that. So we can of course take an order of mid-life rebuilds. And then, of course you need to plan those rebuilds very carefully because you can't take the full fleet off and do the rebuilds. So you do that step by step. So there of course you have a delay in revenue.[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Andrew Wilson from JPMorgan.I just wanted to ask on the infrastructure side of the, I guess, of the portfolio. We've obviously talked a lot about mining. And I guess seeing that the hydraulics have done particularly well, I would guess that's more driven by infrastructure, but sort of elsewhere. Can we kind of take some of the same comments that you've made I guess on the group as a whole that's also relevant for infrastructure? Or would you be pulling out, I guess, different trends whether by region or products in terms of the infrastructure side versus mining? Just trying to sort of cover off the side of the portfolio.So we see that infrastructure is picking up as well. We see it in -- of course, China has been healthy throughout last year. But what we have seen in Q1 now is also U.S. picking up as well as Europe. And that goes both for hydraulic attachment, which is very much the actual work. And you can also see that on consumables towards these 2 segments. So activity levels are clearly higher in infrastructure now than compared to last year.The next question comes from the line of Karl Bokvist from ABG.My question was what's related to the infrastructure part here. And I think you partly answered it already. But I think just overall, should we keep anything in mind when it comes to mix if you're growing in infrastructure compared to mining? And also, do you think that, I mean, this quarter infrastructure grew almost 30% versus mining, low single digits on reported orders. I think for the remainder of the year, do you think that mining will outgrow infrastructure? Or do you have any thoughts on this?I guess it depends all on the stimulus packages here and when that will start to kick in. What we see so far is more the activities on existing -- the existing excavators out there, existing machines out in the infrastructure, and they are being used more hours. That is really what has translated into the orders. Then there are of course projects ongoing in several parts of the world. And we have a very strong offering towards the infrastructure as well on the equipment side.There are no further questions at this time. Please go ahead, speakers.Wonderful. So then it's me back again. Thank you for all the questions. You did well. They were short and concise. Thank you, Anders and Helena, for a good presentation. To all of you out there, we will see you again in July for our Q2 presentation. And then in October. And as Helena mentioned, we have our Capital Markets Day in December. So please note that in your calendar. Stay safe and take care. Thank you very much, all of you. Bye-bye.Thank you.Thank you so much.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore.Happy to finally be covering the stock.Yes, welcome to the fold.I wish I've been quicker on the uptake and got all of the outperformance the last couple of years. So be it. So I just -- I've asked you this question before, and I just wanted to ask it again. Obviously, the performance in the quarter was great, and you've got $1.4 billion in capital still in the budget. Vast majority of your -- are covered by riders. And you've got this sort of 4% to 6% long-term earnings guidance drive out there. But the rate base growth guidance range is 6% to 8%. So how do we -- obviously, that's very enticing, and it seems like -- there seems like there's a lot of cushion in there. But you first gave that well before the bonus depreciation rules were extended for 5 years. So can you tell us about how that may have moved things around inside the guidance range? It still seems like you're well positioned to, at the minimum, hit the high end of the earnings guidance range, but maybe the rate base growth is less robust because of bonus d and what you might do to offset that.Yes, thanks, Greg, and it's a fairly common question, as you noted. I'll ask Donald to touch on the bonus and the relative impact on rate base and how we're navigating through that, but let me take this sort of the higher-level question about the relationship between our outlook, our guidance and our business plan. We think and firmly believe that one of the strengths of the NiSource story is the long-term visibility, the sustained investment platform we have that we outlined, as we noted, a couple of years ago with the $30 billion in investment. As we look through the future and the strong support we have across all 7 states for those kind of investments, that's a great engine for driving growth, the visibility. And I wanted to be sure that we put out a fairly long-term look at earnings guidance in that 4% to 6% annual growth range. We remain committed to that. As we've noted before, the relationship between investments and rate base that are tracked, the ongoing support for those investments is offset in some ways, in a couple of ways, by regulatory lag, continued O&M growth that gets picked up in rate cases that don't have quite the same effect as the trackers have. A bit of conservatism in our outlook and then, over the long term, the need to finance that in a balanced way. That story remains the same today. I will ask Donald to touch on the effect of bonus. As we've noted, our guidance remains the same for the year and our growth guidance remains the same, but a little bit of insight about the relationship of bonus depreciation would be helpful.Yes. And so think about the bonus depreciation on our rate base, it certainly has a detrimental impact over our plan, years, and we typically look out 4 to 5 years. And so what we've done to offset that is to increase our capital spend a little bit over the next couple of years to offset the impact of the rate base. But then when you look at it over a 4-, 5-year period, we actually do have positive cash flows through the period. If you'll remember, we've got NOLs that, before this extension of bonus depreciation, went out through 2018. With this extension of bonus depreciation, our NOL will now go out to -- the end of 2022. So from a cash standpoint, as the detriment early with the bonus depreciation because of the NOL position but on the back end of the year, we do have a cash pickup. And so with the cash we'll spend in the next couple of years to offset the rate base degradation, we'll come out slightly ahead over kind of a 5- or 6-year period. So I think all in all, we're looking at staying within that range. It doesn't challenge our earnings growth story. And at the same time, I think as Joe talked a little bit about conservatism, we understand we're in multiple rate cases at any time. There's certainly some risk from amount realized as well as just the timing of when rates go into effect, and so trying to balance out the understanding of the risk of both kind of regulatory mechanisms as well as kind of O&M, which doesn't go into the trackers. We feel confident we'll certainly be in the range, but, obviously, have some opportunities if everything goes the right way to be at the higher end of the range.Our next question comes from the line of Larry Louis [ph] from JPMorgan.Just wanted to walk through the decision process on the term loan. Was it more economically-driven? Or was it more so a flexibility decision when it comes to kind of call provisions on the term loans?I'd say it's both. We're looking at the need for this year and looking at what are our different options, really did want to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and the interest savings that provided as well as making sure we've got kind of a full toolkit for financing our company going forward. So I'd say it's a little bit of both. And I think going forward, we'll look at both the bond market as well as take advantage of the bank market in term loans.Got you. And can you just remind us what are your financing needs? I noticed that you paid down the rest of your 10% handle that remained outstanding.Yes. So this year, I would expect that we wouldn't have any significant financing needs. This term loan, which we took out, we haven't actually tapped into yet and won't tap into until later this year. But I don't expect anything significant this year. But certainly, we're always looking in our portfolio. We do have some higher cost of debt in the portfolio, and so looking for opportunities to bring down our overall cost of debt. If the market and the timing make sense, we would do that as well.Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar.Just to follow up on that bonus depreciation question. I noticed, Joe, in your comments, introductory comments, I believe you said CapEx for '16 more than $1.4 billion where I believe, last quarter, it was approximately $1.4 billion. Is that consistent with Donald's comments about accelerating CapEx because of the cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation?Yes. Thanks, Charles, and good morning. That's very perceptive. It's entirely consistent. There's not a big shift into 2016. Donald's comment is related to the near-term years of the plan to offset the NOL issues and to help with the outer years of the plan on an earnings standpoint. But it's all around the $1.4 billion as we've navigated through the 2016 planning cycle.Okay. And then my next question is on the pace or the -- excuse me, the settlement on the electric modernization program. Does that -- are we done? Does that pretty much eliminate any of the excitement that we've seen, regulatory, legal? I mean are you pretty confident we're on the [indiscernible].We're confident -- yes, I'm sorry. I like your term excitement. But we're confident that we've got a framework vis-a-vis the settlement that we filed. We are still in the regulatory process, so we still have the remaining steps through the regulatory process that we would expect to resolve early in the third quarter this year but feel very good about the position we're in. And we've remained committed to making those investments, so that's all part of the framework that we've set up.Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.Just with bonus depreciation, what's your current view on when you may need to come back to push some equity?We don't see any real shift at this point in our outlook relative to bonus. We continue to not see a need for equity in the near term of the plan and, as you would guess, with bonus, that didn't change at all. We continue to look at our total plan, including CapEx, dividend policy and the ultimate need for equity but, at this point, not ready to change our outlook on any of those factors.And then, strategically, it seems like a lot of large cap electrics kind of want to get some gas exposure. How are you thinking about the opportunity there?Well, we remain committed to our plan. As we've watched that play out, we look at our plan and don't really need M&A to drive our opportunities going forward. Very focused on, as we've talked about at length today, the capital investments and the regulatory cadence that we set up in our plan and, certainly, don't see M&A as a part of that strategy. That said, with anything that would be compelling being introduced into the mix, we'd certainly take a look at that.Certainly, you don't need the growth opportunity but maybe there's some players out there who could use your opportunities.I'm sure that's fine.And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore.Guys, I had a follow-up question, it's on a completely different subject. When I look at --  I'm looking at the NEXUS Pipeline project that's being jointly built by Spectra and DTE. And in their first quarter slide deck, Slide 25, they show the path of that pipeline going through your service territory in Ohio, and the sort of massive amount of interest -- interconnect agreements, of up to 1.75 Bcf a day. And some of the names of your gas utilities are very prominent on that list. Can you talk about your needs for incremental gas supply and how likely it is that you'd be taking gas off the Nexus pipeline and in what amounts?Yes, Greg, that's something we keep an eye on but not something that we're actively interested in and involved in at this point, good position on capacity in the Midwest. More of our focus these days is in New England and Massachusetts. As you know, we had a position -- we have a position in the Northeast Direct Pipeline Project. So a lot of focus there on how to ensure that we have what we need up there. We will continue to keep an eye on the Midwest. And if we see an opportunity, we'll certainly participate.Okay. So you're definitely interested in the capacity on the pipes going into New England and this is more of a wait-and-see situation?Yes, more -- that's a good way to characterize it. Again, if we see an opportunity there that makes sense, we'll certainly take advantage of that.Okay. And what's the time line that you would normally seriously consider a formal interconnect agreement on a new pipe? You would wait for that pipe to be sort of firmly under construction before you would have a serious conversation with them? I'm just -- I'm not that familiar with the process there.Yes. Typically, there's an open season upfront. We'd participate in that, express interest that usually precedes any actual construction. So we'd be ahead of that curve to help underpin the fundamentals for the project itself. But that's not always the case. Sometimes, there's opportunistic, second pass, third pass opportunities to take advantage of a new project. So it really varies depending on our supply/demand balance, our existing contracts and the growth opportunities in that region. So I don't think there's a precise recipe that applies in all cases.Yes. But this would be a second or a third pass type deal because they did their open season, they're 65% or 66% contracted. 50% with LDCs up at the top end of the pipe, the other 50% of that is producers. And then they've been talking about the potential for incremental interconnect agreements along the length of the pipe. So am I right to say that, that would be a second or third pass type of deal?I want to be careful that my general comment there is not characterizing a specific project or a specific interest. This is an area we continue to look at. But on that specific project, I'm not providing any specific outlook on our participation at this point.[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Joe Hamrock for any closing remarks.Thank you, Skylar, and let me again express our appreciation for your participation and interest today and ongoing interest in the NiSource story. Please have a great day. Thank you very much.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take the first question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.A quick question. If we just sort of flowed through some of the upside from this quarter, that gets us up to probably a little bit ahead of where you're talking about from a revenue standpoint. And that's without really sort of changing our view of the underlying business momentum, FX, et cetera. So can you talk a little bit about why you're not expecting, I guess, some of the better top line momentum to flow through to the full year? Or is that the case?Well, John, well, we're still early in the turnaround, and we are exercising careful optimism. We have a portfolio of markets and they're not growing in -- we're turning in a linear fashion. So we do expect the core established markets to continue growing in 2016 but because we're still in the early stages, several of the other markets and it's a mixed portfolio, we're exercising this careful optimism now. I hope you understand.Okay. That sounds great. And then I guess, as we look at the scanner data and we have obviously, very limited channels available in North America as we look at this. The underlying business looks stronger. So can you talk a little bit more about your channel dynamics in North America? And what you're seeing there that maybe we're not seeing in terms of some of the syndicated data?Well, don't forget that the NPD data does not include one of our strongest and most strategic customers, which is Bed Bath & Beyond. So it's worth looking at that as well. But what we're seeing in the U.S. is some traction on the -- it's emerging traction. Some of it, I cannot report on right now. As far as expanding -- and some of it I've spoken to in the prepared remarks, as far as expanding our footprint at retail, I can give it as an example. One of our strategic accounts has agreed with us to expand their product range from 2 machines to 3 already this holiday season. So between the expansion of our product range, the inclusion of additional doors, the fact that we are moving towards home delivery, we're also revisiting things like home shopping. There's a lot of reason for us to be cautiously optimistic also about the U.S. market.And our next question is from Tony Brenner with Roth Capital Partners.I have 2 questions. First of all, regarding home delivery. Daniel, I take that a big part of the attraction for retailers carrying the brand is that it drives traffic into the stores as a result of the gas exchange. If home delivery really does gain traction and takes away some of that exchange at retail, at the same time you're trying to increase shelf space in those same retailers, why isn't that a conflict of interest?Tony, we have experience in our other market, beverage. The only market we are active in, in the world that does not provide home delivery of gas exchanges right now is the U.S. So we have evidence to indicate that the fact that we are able to service customers, consumers at home with the gas exchange only enhances the performance at retail. This is the overall household penetration. And I expect that will be the case in the United States. By the way, the same argument holds true for e-commerce. It used to be the case where retailers objected to e-commerce and over the more recent years, have discovered that e-commerce, even if it's not within their e-commerce channel, but a competitive e-commerce channel, e-commerce grows the total pie.Okay. And my second question is, I believe in the past, you've talked about beginning to penetrate the drug channel, particularly with gas exchange. I wonder if you could update that effort. And will be strictly gas exchange? Or will one or more of those larger chains carry the full line of SodaStream products?At this point, I have nothing specific to report other than the fact that it is very much a priority, and we're still working on it. And our objective is to secure a significant drug channel partner/ convenience partner as a gas-exchange-only retailer.[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Pablo Zuanic with SIG.Just 2 questions. First, I'm trying to understand better if you can give us more color in terms of the growth in Western Europe. I mean, ex FX, this quarter, it seems that you grew there around 17%, roughly, I think, I calculate. You were growing in the second half there 7% to 9%, ex FX. Just to clarify, was acceleration mostly from those markets you called turnaround, while the growth in Germany, Austria, Switzerland pretty much kept its pace? If can expand on that? And then if you can answer that first, and then I have a follow-up.Okay, Pablo, I'm going to ask Henner Rinsche, who's on the line with us to give some color about the performance in Western Europe.So Pablo, so the main driver of growth in Western Europe has been again, Germany, Austria, Switzerland. And very positively Germany experienced its 17th quarter of double-digit revenue growth year-on-year. And Germany really has been the -- sort of originator of our growth strategy. And now we're applying that strategy in more European countries, and as a result in Q1, the Nordics were up year-on-year, the U.K. and France and other countries were also up and sellout. So we're seeing a pretty broad-based growth momentum that is starting now in several European countries.But just to be clear the growth in Germany and Austria, those established markets, did growth also accelerate there or it's all coming from those other markets that you call turnaround markets?No, the established markets were definitely growing double digit as well. And again, for Germany, that's even the 17th quarter in a row, so there's no slowdown of growth in the established markets.Okay, and then just a quick follow-up. I mean, Daniel, in the case of Doug Pritchard, I mean, he only joined, I believe, if I'm not wrong, about 6 months ago. I'm just surprised he was able to turnaround Canada so quickly. If you can just give us some more color on that. I mean, obviously, his experience will help in the U.S. And then the second question unrelated, in the 20 years, there's this discussion about management incentives, bonuses and so on, and there's something there about bonuses that would kick in if the company -- if the leadership is able to negotiate a $25 million investment from outside into the company. I'm just wondering about that $25 million number. It seems pretty low in the scheme of things. If you can just give some color there.No, to put aside the second piece of the question, it's not something we're chasing or -- it was built into the LTIP, but finding a strategic investor is not what we're about right now. We're about building household penetration and profitable growth. So really, I think that would be -- it's not something that I can address directly. It's built into the LTIP. But as far as Doug Pritchard, he did a fantastic job turning around Canada in a short period of time, even less than 6 months. I think it indicates 2 things: One, how talented he is and capable. And also, that when you execute against a simple and a correct strategy in this business, you can achieve incredible response. Especially when the base is low. I mean, Canada was a very small market, similar like the U.S. is, with only about 0.5% -- 0.5% to 1% household penetration a year ago, and now it's more than 2% household penetration. So Doug did a great job, and we can only hope that he'll repeat that type of traction quickly also in the United States.And our next question is from Jonathan Keypour with Deutsche Bank.I just wanted to know if I could get a little more color on the growth in Europe. You mentioned that there was better sell-in than sellout in France. I was just wondering if that would have an effect on 2Q or 3Q going forward. And if you had any color on the timing there.Yes. Jonathan, again, I'll ask Henner to speak to Europe and then I might add a comment. Go ahead Henner.Sure. So I would say that in all other European countries, except France, we've actually seen more growth on sellout than on sell-in. France is one exception where we've had very good sell-in, but sellout was up year-on-year only on refills but not yet on the total business. But so no, there's no reason for pessimism going forward in Europe because sellout overall is going pretty well in Germany, Nordics, in Sweden, Finland, Norway, in U.K. and Belgium, Switzerland, almost everywhere were we buy data, sellout is up year-on-year.And that's right. And Jonathan, I'd only add to that, that the numbers we reported Q1, on top of them, there was a $2.8 million negative FX impact. So indeed, Europe is doing very, very well across the board.Can I have a follow-up question?Sure.I was just wondering about the U.S. you mentioned that there's a push for the right marketing message and enhancing in-store presence. I was wondering if you could speak to maybe how that would float to overall selling and marketing expenses throughout the quarters for 2016.Well, we're expecting A&P to be -- for the remainder of the year to be allocated equally, more or less, among the 3 remaining quarters, which on a percentage increase basis, would represent the highest percent increase in the second quarter. But we will have to see how the -- in the U.S. specifically, let's remember the U.S. is only -- is less than 20% of the total revenue of the company. But nevertheless, it represents a huge opportunity. And if we see that the U.S. market is responding well to this campaign, then we might do some reallocations that are correct for this business.And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Birnbaum, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.Thank you very much. And thank you for joining us today. We look forward to updating everyone on our continued progress during our second quarter call in August. And to our Israeli investors and analysts, I wish a meaningful Memorial Day that starts this evening and a happy Independence Day immediately following, neither to be taken for granted here in Israel. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you.This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
